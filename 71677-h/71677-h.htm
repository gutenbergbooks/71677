  <p><b>The Free Amoeboid Cell.</b>&mdash;If we examine under the microscope a fragment of one of
  the higher animals or plants, we find in it a very complex structure. A careful study shows that
  it always consists of certain minute elements of fundamentally the same nature, which are combined
  or fused into "tissues." In plants, where these units of structure were first studied, and where
  they are easier to recognise, each tiny unit is usually enclosed in an envelope or wall of woody
  or papery material, so that the whole plant is honeycombed. Each separate cavity was at first
  called a "cell"; and this term was then applied to the bounding wall, and finally to the unit of
  living matter within, the envelope receiving the name of "cell-wall." In this modern sense the
  "cell" consists of a viscid substance, called first in animals "sarcode" by Dujardin (1835), and
  later in plants "protoplasm"<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> by Von Mohl (1846). On
  the recognition of its common nature in both kingdoms, largely due to Max Schultze, the latter
  term prevailed; and it has passed from the vocabulary of biology into the domain of everyday life.
  We shall now examine the structure and behaviour of protoplasm and of the cell as an introduction
  to the detailed study of the Protozoa, or better still Protista,<a id="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the lowest types of living beings, and of Animals at large.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page4"><span class="smaller">{4}</span></span></div>

  <p>It is not in detached fragments of the tissues of the higher animals that we can best carry on
  this study: for here the cells are in singularly close connexion with their neighbours during
  life; the proper appointed work of each is intimately related to that of the others; and this
  co-operation has so trained and specially modified each cell that the artificial severance and
  isolation is detrimental to its well-being, if not necessarily fatal to its very life. Again, in
  plants the presence of a cell-wall interferes in many ways with the free behaviour of the cell.
  But in the blood and lymph of higher animals there float isolated cells, the white corpuscles or
  "leucocytes" of human histology, which, despite their minuteness (<span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3000</span> in. in diameter), are in many respects
  suitable objects. Further, in our waters, fresh or salt, we may find similar free-living
  individual cells, in many respects resembling the leucocytes, but even better suited for our
  study. For, in the first place, we can far more readily reproduce under the microscope the normal
  conditions of their life; and, moreover, these free organisms are often many times larger than the
  leucocyte. Such free organisms are individual Protozoa, and are called by the general term
  "Amoebae." A large Amoeba may measure in its most contracted state <span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span> in. or <span class="wnw">250 &micro;</span> in
  diameter,<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and some closely allied species
  (<i>Pelomyxa</i>, see p. <a href="#page52">52</a>) even twelve times this amount. If we place an
  Amoeba or a leucocyte under the microscope (Fig. 1), we shall find that its form, at first
  spherical, soon begins to alter. To confine our attention to the external changes, we note that
  the outline, from circular, soon becomes "island-shaped" by the outgrowth of a promontory here,
  the indenting of a bay there. The promontory may enlarge into a peninsula, and thus grow until it
  becomes a new mainland, while the old mainland dwindles into a mere promontory, and is finally
  lost. In this way a crawling motion is effected.<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The
  promontories are called "pseudopodia" (= <span class="pagenum" id="page5"><span
  class="smaller">{5}</span></span>"false-feet"), and the general character of such motion is called
  "amoeboid."<a id="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;<i>Amoeba</i>, showing clear ectoplasm,
      granular endoplasm, dark nucleus, and lighter contractile vacuole. The changes of form,
      <i>a-f</i>, are of the <i>A. limax</i> type; <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, of the <i>A. proteus</i>
      type. (From Verworn.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The living substance, protoplasm,<a id="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> has been termed
  a "jelly," a word, however, that is quite inapplicable to it in its living state. It is viscid,
  almost semi-fluid, and may well be compared to very soft dough which has already begun to rise. It
  resembles it in often having a number of spaces, small or large, filled with liquid (not gas).
  These are termed "vacuoles" or "alveoles," according to their greater or their lesser dimensions.
  In some cases a vacuole is traversed by strands of plasmic substance, just as we may find such
  strands stretching across the larger spaces of a very light loaf; but of course in the living cell
  these are constantly undergoing changes. If we "fix" a cell (<i>i.e.</i> kill it by <span
  class="pagenum" id="page6"><span class="smaller">{6}</span></span>sudden heat or certain chemical
  coagulants),<a id="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and examine it under the microscope, the
  intermediate substance between the vacuoles that we have already seen in life is again found
  either to be finely honeycombed or else resolved into a network like that of a sponge. The former
  structure is called a "foam" or "alveolar" structure, the latter a "reticulate" structure. The
  alveoles are about <span class="wnw">1 &micro;</span> in diameter, and spheroidal or polygonal by mutual
  contact, elongated, however, radially to any free surface, whether it be that of the cell itself
  or that of a larger alveole or vacuole. The inner layer of protoplasm ("endoplasm," "endosarc")
  contains also granules of various nature, reserve matters of various kinds, oil-globules, and
  particles of mineral matter<a id="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> which are waste products,
  and are called "excretory." In fixed specimens these granules are seen to occupy the nodes of the
  network or of the alveoli, that is, the points where two or three boundaries meet.<a id="NtA_9"
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> The outermost layer ("ectoplasm" or "ectosarc") appears in the
  live Amoeba structureless and hyaline, even under conditions the most favourable for observation.
  The refractive index of protoplasm, when living, is always well under 1.4, that of the fixed and
  dehydrated substance is slightly over 1.6.</p>

  <p>Again, within the outer protoplasm is found a body of slightly higher refractivity and of
  definite outline, termed the "nucleus" (Figs. 1, 2). This has a definite "wall" of plasmic nature,
  and a substance so closely resembling the outer protoplasm in character, that we call it the
  "nucleoplasm" (also "linin"), distinguishing the outer plasm as "cytoplasm"; the term "protoplasm"
  including both. Within the nucleoplasm are granules of a substance that stains well with the
  commoner dyes, especially the "basic" ones, and which has hence been called "chromatin." The linin
  is <span class="pagenum" id="page7"><span class="smaller">{7}</span></span>usually arranged in a
  distinct network, confluent into a "parietal layer" within the nuclear wall; the meshes traversing
  a cavity full of liquid, the nuclear sap, and containing in their course the granules; while in
  the cavity are usually found one or two droplets of a denser substance termed "nucleoles." These
  differ slightly in composition from the chromatin granules<a id="NtA_10"
  href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> (see p. <a href="#page24">24</a> f.).</p>

  <p>The movements of the leucocyte or Amoeba are usually most active at a temperature of about 40&deg;
  C. or 100&deg; F., the "optimum." They cease when the temperature falls to a point, the "minimum,"
  varying with the organism, but never below freezing-point; they recommence when the temperature
  rises again to the same point at which they stopped. If now the temperature be raised to a certain
  amount above 40&deg; they stop, but may recommence if the temperature has not exceeded a certain
  point, the "maximum" (45&deg; C. is a common maximum). If it has been raised to a still higher point
  they will not recommence under any circumstances whatever.</p>

  <p>Again, a slight electric shock will determine the retraction of all processes, and a period of
  rest in a spherical condition. A milder shock will only arrest the movements. But a stronger shock
  may arrest them permanently. We may often note a relation of the movements towards a surface,
  tending to keep the Amoeba in contact with it, whether it be the surface of a solid or that of an
  air-bubble in the liquid (see also p. <a href="#page20">20</a>).</p>

  <p>If a gentle current be set up in the water, we find that the movements of the Amoeba are so
  co-ordinated that it moves upstream; this must of course be of advantage in nature, as keeping the
  being in its place, against the streams set up by larger creatures, etc. (see also p. <a
  href="#page21">21</a>).</p>

  <p>If substances soluble in water be introduced the Amoeba will, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page8"><span class="smaller">{8}</span></span>as a rule, move away from the region of greater
  concentration for some substances, but towards it (provided it be not excessive) for others. (See
  also pp. <a href="#page22">22</a>, <a href="#page23">23</a>.) We find, indeed, that there is for
  substances of the latter category a minimum of concentration, below which no effect is seen, and a
  maximum beyond which further concentration repels. The easiest way to make such observations is to
  take up a little strong solution in a capillary tube sealed at the far end, and to introduce its
  open end into the water, and let the solution diffuse out, so that this end may be regarded as
  surrounded by zones of continuously decreasing strength. In the process of inflammation (of a
  Higher Animal) it has been found that the white corpuscles are so attracted by the source of
  irritation that they creep out of the capillaries, and crowd towards it.</p>

  <p>We cannot imagine a piece of dough exhibiting any of these reactions, or the like of them; it
  can only move passively under the action of some one or other of the recognised physical forces,
  and that only in direct <i>quantitative</i> relation to the work that such forces can effect; in
  other words, the dough can have work done on it, but it cannot do work. The Amoeba or leucocyte on
  the contrary does work. It moves under the various circumstances by the transformation of some of
  its internal energy from the "potential" into the "kinetic" state, the condition corresponding
  with this being essentially a liberation of heat or work, either by the breaking down of its
  internal substances, or by the combination of some of them with oxygen.<a id="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Such of these changes as involve the excretion of carbonic acid
  are termed "respiratory."</p>

  <p>This liberation of energy is the "response" to an action of itself inadequate to produce it;
  and has been compared not inaptly to the discharge of a cannon, where foot-tons of energy are
  liberated in consequence of the pull of a few inch-grains on the trigger, or to an indefinitely
  small push which makes electric contact: the energy set free is that which was stored up in the
  charge. This capacity for liberating energy stored up within, in response to a relatively small
  impulse from without, is termed "irritability"; the external impulse is termed the "stimulus." The
  responsive act has been termed "contractility," because it so often means an obvious contraction,
  but is better termed <span class="pagenum" id="page9"><span
  class="smaller">{9}</span></span>"motility "; and irritability evinced by motility is
  characteristic of all living beings save when in the temporary condition of "rest."</p>

  <p>Again, in the case of the cannon, the gunner after its discharge has to replenish it for future
  action with a fresh cartridge; the Amoeba or leucocyte can replenish itself&mdash;it "feeds." When
  it comes in contact with a fragment of suitable material, it enwraps it by its pseudopodia (Fig.
  3), and its edges coalesce where they touch on the far side as completely as we can join up the
  edges of dough round the apple in a dumpling. It dissolves all that can be
  dissolved&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it "digests" it, and then absorbs the dissolved material into its
  substance, both to replace what it has lost by its previous activity and to supply fuel for future
  liberation of energy; this process is termed "nutrition," and is another characteristic of living
  beings.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Again, as a second result of the nutrition, part of the food taken in goes to effect an
  increase of the living protoplasm, and that of every part, not merely of the surface&mdash;it is
  "assimilated"; while the rest of the food is transformed into reserves, or consumed and directly
  applied to the liberation of energy. The increase in bulk due to nutrition is thus twofold: part
  is the increase of the protoplasm itself&mdash;"assimilative growth," part is the storage of
  reserves&mdash;"accumulative growth": these reserves being available in turn by digestion, whether
  for future true growth or for consumption to liberate energy for the work of the cell.</p>

  <p>We can conceive that our cannon might have an automatic feed for the supply of fresh cartridges
  after each shot; but not that it could make provision for an increase of its own bulk, so as to
  gain in calibre and strength, nor even for the restoration <span class="pagenum" id="page10"><span
  class="smaller">{10}</span></span>of its inner surface constantly worn away by the erosion of its
  discharges. Growth&mdash;and that growth "interstitial," operating at every point of the
  protoplasm, not merely at its surface&mdash;is a character of all living beings at some stage,
  though they may ultimately lose the capacity to grow. Nothing at all comparable to interstitial
  growth has been recognised in not-living matter.<a id="NtA_12"

  </div>

  <p>Again, when an Amoeba has grown to a certain size, its nucleus divides into two nuclei, and its
  cytoplasmic body, as we may term it, elongates, narrows in the middle so as to assume the shape of
  a dumb-bell or finger-biscuit, and the two halves, crawling in opposite directions, separate by
  the giving way of the connecting waist, forming two new Amoebas, each with its nucleus (Fig. 4).
  This is a process of "reproduction"; the special case is one of "equal fission" or "binary
  division." The original cell is termed the "mother," with respect to the two new ones, and these
  are of course with respect to it the "daughters," and <span class="pagenum" id="page11"><span
  class="smaller">{11}</span></span>"sisters" to one another. We must bear in mind that in this
  self-sacrificing maternity the mother is resolved into her children, and her very existence is
  lost in their production. The above phenomena, <span class="smaller">IRRITABILITY</span>, <span
  class="smaller">MOTILITY</span>, <span class="smaller">DIGESTION</span>, <span
  class="smaller">NUTRITION</span>, <span class="smaller">GROWTH</span>, <span
  class="smaller">REPRODUCTION</span>, are all characteristic of living beings at some stage or
  other, though one or more may often be temporarily or permanently absent; they are therefore
  called "vital processes."</p>

  <p>If, on the other hand, we violently compress the cell, if we pass a very strong electric shock
  through it, or a strong continuous current, or expose it to a temperature much above 45&deg; C., or to
  the action of certain chemical substances, such as strong acids or alkalies, or alcohol or
  corrosive sublimate, we find that all these vital processes are arrested once and for all;
  henceforward the cell is on a par with any not-living substance. Such a change is called "<span
  class="smaller">DEATH</span>," and the "capacity for death" is one of the most marked characters
  of living beings. This change is associated with changes in the mechanical and optical properties
  of the protoplasm, which loses its viscidity and becomes opaque, having undergone a process of
  <i>de</i>-solution; for the water it contained is now held only mechanically in the interstices of
  a network, or in cavities of a honeycomb (as we have noted above, p. <a href="#page5">5</a>),
  while the solid forming the residuum has a refractive index of a little over 1.6. Therefore, it
  only regains its full transparency when the water is replaced by a liquid of high refractive
  index, such as an essential oil or phenol. A similar change may be effected by pouring white of
  egg into boiling water or absolute alcohol, and is attended with the same optical results. The
  study of the behaviour of coagulable colloids has been recently studied by Fischer and by Hardy,
  and has been of the utmost service in our interpretation of the microscopical appearances shown in
  biological specimens under the microscope.<a id="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page12"><span class="smaller">{12}</span></span></div>

  <p>The death of the living being finds a certain analogy in the breaking up or the wearing out of
  a piece of machinery; but in no piece of machinery do we find the varied irritabilities, all
  conducive to the well-being of the organism (under ordinary conditions), or the so-called
  "automatic processes"<a id="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> that enable the living being
  to go through its characteristic functions, to grow, and as we shall see, even to turn conditions
  unfavourable for active life and growth to the ultimate weal of the species (see p. <a
  href="#page32">32</a>). At the same time, we fully recognise that for supplies of matter and
  energy the organism, like the machine, depends absolutely on sources from without. The debtor and
  creditor sheet, in respect of matter and energy, can be proved to balance between the outside
  world and Higher Organisms with the utmost accuracy that our instruments can attain; and we
  <i>infer</i> that this holds for the Lower Organisms also. Many of the changes within the organism
  can be expressed in terms of chemistry and physics; but it is far more impossible to state them
  <i>all</i> in such terms than it would be to describe a polyphase electrical installation in terms
  of dynamics and hydraulics. And so far at least we are justified in speaking of "vital
  forces."</p>

  <p>The living substance of protoplasm contains a large quantity of water, at least two-thirds its
  mass, as we have seen, in a state of physical or loose chemical combination with solids: these on
  death yield proteids and nucleo-proteids.<a id="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> The
  living protoplasm <span class="pagenum" id="page13"><span class="smaller">{13}</span></span>has an
  alkaline reaction, while the liquid in the larger vacuoles, at least, is acid, especially in
  Plant-cells.<a id="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Metabolism.</b>&mdash;The chemical processes that go on in the organism are termed metabolic
  changes, and were roughly divided by Gaskell into (1) "anabolic," in which more complex and less
  stable substances are built up from less complex and more stable ones with the absorption of
  energy; and (2) "catabolic" changes in which the reverse takes place. Anabolic processes, in all
  but the cells containing plastids or chromatophores (see p. <a href="#page36">36</a>) under the
  influence of light, necessarily imply the furnishing of energy by concurrent catabolic changes in
  the food or reserves, or in the protoplasm itself.</p>

  <p>Again, we have divided anabolic processes into "accumulative," where the substances formed are
  merely reserves for the future use of the cell, and "assimilative," where the substances go to the
  building of the protoplasm itself, whether for the purpose of growth or for that of repair.</p>

  <p>Catabolic processes may involve (1) the mere breaking of complex substances into simpler ones,
  or (2) their combination with oxygen; in either case waste products are formed, which may either
  be of service to the organism as "secretions" (like the bile in Higher Animals), or of no further
  use (like the urine). When nitrogenous substances break down in this way they give rise to
  "excretions," containing urea, urates, and allied substances; other products of catabolism are
  carbon dioxide, water, and mineral salts, such as sulphates, phosphates, carbonates, oxalates,
  etc., which if not insoluble must needs be removed promptly from the organism, many of them being
  injurious or even poisonous. The energy liberated by the protoplasm being derived through the
  breakdown of another part of the same or of the <span class="pagenum" id="page14"><span
  class="smaller">{14}</span></span>food-materials or stored reserves, must give rise to waste
  products. The exchange of oxygen from without for carbonic acid formed within is termed
  "respiration," and is distinguished from the mere removal of all other waste products called
  "excretion." In the fresh-water Amoeba both these processes can be studied.</p>

  <p><b>Respiration</b>,<a id="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> or the interchange of
  gases, must, of course, take place all over the general surface, but in addition it is combined in
  most fresh-water Protista with <i>excretion</i> in an organ termed the "contractile" or "pulsatile
  vacuole" (Figs. 1, 4, etc.). This particular vacuole is exceptional in its size and its constancy
  of position. At intervals, more or less regular, it is seen to contract, and to expel its contents
  through a pore; at each contraction it completely disappears, and reforms slowly, sometimes
  directly, sometimes by the appearance of a variable number of small "formative" vacuoles that run
  together, or as in Ciliata, by the discharge into it of so-called "feeding canals." As this
  vacuole is filled by the water that diffuses through the substance, and when distended may reach
  one-third the diameter of the being, in the interval between two contractions an amount of water
  must have soaked in equal to one-twenty-seventh the bulk of the animal, to be excreted with
  whatever substances it has taken up in solution, including, not only carbon dioxide, but also, it
  has been shown, nitrogenised waste matters allied to uric acid.<a id="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

  <p>That the due interchanges may take place between the cell and the surrounding medium, it is
  obvious that certain limits to the ratio between bulk and surface must exist, which are disturbed
  by growth, and which we shall study hereafter (p. <a href="#page23">23</a> f.).</p>

  <p>The Protista that live in water undergo a death by "diffluence" or "granular disintegration" on
  being wounded, crushed, or sometimes after an excessive electric stimulation, or contact with
  alkalies or with acids too weak to coagulate them. In this process the protoplasm breaks up from
  the surface inwards into a mass of granules, the majority of which themselves finally dissolve. If
  the injury be a local rupture of the external pellicle or <span class="pagenum" id="page15"><span
  class="smaller">{15}</span></span>cuticle, a vacuole forms at the point, grows and distends the
  overlying cytoplasm, which finally ruptures: the walls of the vacuole disintegrate; and this goes
  on as above described. Ciliate Infusoria are especially liable to this disintegration process,
  often termed "diffluence," which, repeatedly described by early observers, has recently been
  studied in detail by Verworn. Here we have death by "solution," while in the "fixing" of
  protoplasm for microscopic processes we strive to ensure death by "desolution," so as to retain as
  much of the late living matter as possible. It would seem not improbable that the unusual contact
  with water determines the formation of a zymase that acts on the living substance itself.</p>

  <p>We have suggested<a id="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> that one function of the
  contractile vacuole, in naked fresh-water Protists, is to afford a regular means of discharge of
  the water constantly taken up by the crystalloids in the protoplasm, and so to check the tendency
  to form irregular disruptive vacuoles and death by diffluence. This is supported by the fact that
  in the holophytic fresh-water Protista, as well as the Algae and Fungi, a contractile vacuole is
  present in the young naked stage (zoospore), but disappears as soon as an elastic cell-wall is
  formed to counterbalance by its tension the internal osmotic pressure.</p>

  <p><b>Digestion</b> is always essentially a catabolic process, both as regards the substance
  digested and the formation of the digesting substance by the protoplasm. The digesting substance
  is termed a "zymase" or "chemical ferment," and is conjectured to be produced by the partial
  breakdown of the protoplasm. In presence of suitable zymases, many substances are resolved into
  two or more new substances, often taking up the elements of water at the same time, and are said
  to be "dissociated" or "hydrolysed" as the case may be. Thus proteid substances are converted into
  the very soluble substances, "proteoses" and "peptones," often with the concurrent or ultimate
  formation of such relatively simple bodies as leucin, tyrosin, and other amines, etc. Starch and
  glycogen are converted into dextrins and sugars; fats are converted into fatty acids and glycerin.
  It is these products of digestion, and not the actual food-materials (save certain very simple
  sugars), that are really taken up by the protoplasm, <span class="pagenum" id="page16"><span
  class="smaller">{16}</span></span>whether for assimilation, for accumulation, or for the direct
  liberation of energy for the vital processes of the organism.</p>

  <p>Not only food from without, but also reserves formed and stored by the protoplasm itself, must
  be digested by some zymase before they can be utilised by the cell. In all cases of the
  utilisation of reserve matter that have been investigated, it has been found that a zymase is
  formed by the cell itself (or sometimes, in complex organisms, by its neighbours); for, after
  killing the cell in which the process is going on by mechanical means or by alcohol, the process
  of digestion can be carried on in the laboratory.<a id="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>
  The chief digestion of all the animal-feeding Protista is of the same type as in our own stomachs,
  known as "peptic" digestion: this involves the concurrent presence of an acid, and Le Dantec and
  Miss Greenwood have found the contents of food-vacuoles, in which digestion is going on, to
  contain acid liquid. The ferment-pepsin itself has been extracted by Krukenberg from the
  Myxomycete, "Flowers of tan" (<i>Fuligo varians</i>, p. <a href="#page92">92</a>), and by
  Professor Augustus Dixon and the author from the gigantic multinucleate Amoeba, <i>Pelomyxa
  palustris</i> (p. <a href="#page52">52</a>).<a id="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> The
  details of the prehension of food will be treated of under the several groups.</p>

  <p>The two modes of Anabolism&mdash;true "assimilation" in the strictest sense and
  "accumulation"&mdash;may sometimes go on concurrently, a certain proportion of the food material
  going to the protoplasm, and the rest, after allowing for waste, being converted into
  reserves.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><b>Movements</b> all demand catabolic changes, and we now proceed to consider these in more
  detail.</p>

  <p>The movements of an Amoeboid<a id="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> cell are of two
  kinds: "expansion," leading to the formation and enlargement of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page17"><span class="smaller">{17}</span></span>outgrowths, and "contraction," leading to
  their diminution and disappearance within the general surface.<a id="NtA_23"
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> Expansion is probably due to the lessening of the
  surface-tension at the point of outgrowth, contraction to the increase of surface-tension. Verworn
  regards these as due respectively to the combination of the oxygen in the medium with the
  protoplasm in diminishing surface-tension, and the effect of combination with substances from
  within, especially from the nucleus in increasing it. Besides these external movements, there are
  internal movements revealed by the contained granules, which stream freely in the more fluid
  interior. Those Protista that, while exhibiting amoeboid movements, have no clear external layer,
  such as the Radiolaria, Foraminifera, Heliozoa, etc., present this streaming even at the surface,
  the granules travelling up and down the pseudopodia at a rate much greater than the movements of
  these organs themselves. In this case the protoplasm is wetted by the medium, which it is not
  where there is a clear outer layer: for that behaves like a greasy film.</p>

  <p><b>Motile organs.</b>&mdash;Protoplasm often exhibits movements much more highly specialised
  than the simple expansion or retraction of processes, or the general change of form seen in
  Amoeba. If we imagine the activities of a cell concentrated on particular parts, we may well
  suppose that they would be at once more precise and more energetic than we see them in Amoeba or
  the leucocyte. In some free-swimming cells, such as the individual cells known as "Flagellata,"
  the reproductive cells of the lower Plants, or the male cells ("spermatozoa") of Plants as high as
  Ferns, and even of the Highest Animals, there is an extension of the cell into one or more
  elongated lash-like processes, termed "flagella," which, by beating the water in a reciprocating
  or a spiral rhythm, cause the cell to travel through it; or, if the cell be attached, they produce
  currents in the water that bring food particles to the surface of the cell for ingestion. Such
  flagella may, indeed, be seen in some cases to be modified pseudopodia. In other cases part, or
  the whole, of the surface of the cell may be covered with regularly arranged short filaments of
  similar activity (termed "cilia," from their resemblance to a diminutive eyelash), which, however,
  instead of whirling round, bend sharply <span class="pagenum" id="page18"><span
  class="smaller">{18}</span></span>down to the surface and slowly recover; the movement affects the
  cilia successively in a definite direction in waves, and produces, like that of flagella, either
  locomotion of the cell or currents in the medium. We can best realise their action by recalling
  the waves of bending and recovery of the cornstalks in a wind-swept field; if now the haulms of
  the corn executed these movements of themselves, they would determine in the air above a
  breeze-like motion in the direction of the waves (Fig. 5).<a id="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> Such cilia are not infrequent on those cells of even the Highest
  Animals that, like a mosaic, cover free surfaces ("epithelium cells"). In ourselves such cells
  line, for instance, the windpipe. One group of the Protozoa, the "Ciliata," are, as their name
  implies, ciliated cells pure and simple.</p>

      (From Verworn.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The motions of cilia and of flagella are probably also due to changes of surface
  tension&mdash;alternately on one side and the other in the cilium, but passing round in circular
  succession in the flagellum,<a id="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> giving rise to a
  conical rotation like that of a weighted string that is whirled round the head. This motion is,
  however, strongest at the thicker basal part, which assumes a spiral form like a corkscrew of few
  turns, while the thin lash at the tip may seem even to be quietly extended like the point of the
  corkscrew. If the tip of the flagellum adhere, as it sometimes does, to any object, the motions
  induce a jerking motion, which in this case is reciprocating, not rotatory. When the organism is
  free, the flagellum is usually in advance, and the cell follows, rotating at the same time round
  its longitudinal axis; such an anterior flagellum, called a "tractellum," is the common form in
  Protista that possess a single one (Figs. 29, <span class="smaller">7</span>, <span
  class="smaller">8</span>; 30, C). In the spermatozoa of Higher Animals (and some Sporozoa) the
  flagellum is posterior, and is called a "pulsellum."</p>

  <p>The cilium or flagellum may often be traced a certain distance into the substance of the
  cytoplasm to end in a dot of denser, <span class="pagenum" id="page19"><span
  class="smaller">{19}</span></span>readily-staining plasm, which corresponds to a "centrosome" or
  centre of plasmic forces (see below, pp. <a href="#page115">115</a>, <a href="#page121">121</a>,
  <a href="#page141">141</a>); it has been termed a "blepharoplast."<a id="NtA_26"
  href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Again, the cytoplasm may have differentiated in it definite streaks of specially contractile
  character; such streaks within its substance are called "myonemes"; they are, in fact, muscular
  <i>fibrils</i>. A "muscle-cell," in the Higher Animals, is one whose protoplasm is almost entirely
  so modified, with the exception of a small portion of granular cytoplasm investing the nucleus,
  and having mainly a nutritive function.</p>

  <p>Definite muscular fibrils in action shorten, and at the same time become thicker. It seems
  probable that they contain elongated vacuoles, and that the contents of these vary, so that when
  they have an increased osmotic equivalent, the vacuoles absorb water, enlarge, and tend to become
  more spherical, <i>i.e.</i> shorter and thicker, and so the fibril shortens as a whole. The
  relaxation would be due to the diffusion outwards of the solution of the osmotically active
  substances which induced expansion.<a id="NtA_27" href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <b>Motile Reactions</b> of the Protozoa<a id="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
  require study from another point of view: they are either (1) "spontaneous" or "arbitrary," as we
  may say, or (2) responsive to some stimulus. The latter kind we will take first, as they are
  characteristic of all free cells. The stimuli that induce movements of a responsive character are
  as follows:&mdash;(i.) <span class="smaller">MECHANICAL</span>: such as agitation and contact;
  (ii.) force of <span class="smaller">GRAVITY</span>, or <span class="smaller">CENTRIFUGAL
  FORCE</span>; (iii.) <span class="smaller">CURRENTS</span> in the water; (iv.) <span
  class="smaller">RADIANT ENERGY</span> (<span class="smaller">LIGHT</span>); (v.) changes in the
  <span class="smaller">TEMPERATURE</span> of the medium; (vi.) <span class="smaller">ELECTRIC
  CURRENTS</span> through the medium; (vii.) the presence of <span class="smaller">CHEMICAL
  SUBSTANCES</span> in the medium.</p>

  <p>These, or some of them, may induce one of three different results, or a combination thereof:
  (1) a single movement or an arrest of motion; (2) the assumption of a definite position; (3)
  movement of a definite character or direction.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page20"><span class="smaller">{20}</span></span></div>

  <p>(i.) <span class="sc">Mechanical stimuli.</span>&mdash;Any sudden touch with another body tends
  to arrest all motion; and if the shock be protracted or severe, the retraction of the pseudopodia
  follows. It is to this reaction that we must ascribe the retracted condition of the pseudopodia of
  most Rhizopods when first placed on the slide and covered for microscopic examination.
  Free-swimming Protista may, after hitting any body, either remain in contact with it, or else,
  after a pause, <i>reverse</i> their movement, turn over and swim directly away. This combination
  of movements is characteristic as a reaction of what we may term "repellent" stimuli in general.<a
  id="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Another mechanical reaction is that to continuous
  contact with a solid; and the surface film of water, either at the free surface or round an
  air-bubble, may play the part of a solid in exciting it; we term it "thigmotaxy" or "stereotaxy."
  When positive it determines a movement on to the surface, or a gliding movement along it, or
  merely the arrest of motion and prolongation of contact; when <i>negative</i>, a contact is
  followed by the retreat of the being. Thus <i>Paramecium</i> (Fig. 55, p. <a
  href="#page151">151</a>) and many other Ciliates are led to aggregate about solid particles or
  masses of organic <i>d&eacute;bris</i> in the water, which indeed serve to supply their food. On contact,
  the cell ceases to move its cilia except those of the oral groove; as these lash backwards, they
  hold the front end in close contact with the solid, at the same time provoking a backward stream
  down the groove, which may bring in minute particles from the mass.</p>

  <p>(ii.) Most living beings are able to maintain their level in water by floating or crawling
  against <span class="sc">Gravity</span>, and they react in virtue of the same power against
  centrifugal force. This mode of irritability is termed (negative) "geotaxy" or "barotaxy." We can
  estimate the power of resisting such force by means of a whirling machine, since when the
  acceleration is greater than the resistance stimulated thereby in the beings, they are passively
  sent to the sides of the vessel. The Flagellates, <i>Euglena</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, begin
  to migrate towards the centre when exposed to a centrifugal force about equal to &frac12; G (G = 32.2
  feet or 982 cm. per second); they remain at the centre until the centrifugal force is increased to
  8 G; above that they yield to the force, and are driven passively to the sides. The reaction
  ceases or is reversed at high temperatures.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page21"><span class="smaller">{21}</span></span></div>

  <p>(iii.) <span class="sc">Rheotaxy.</span>&mdash;This is the tendency to move against the stream
  in flowing water. It is shown by most Protists, and can be conveniently studied in the large
  amoeboid plasmodia of the Myxomycetes, which crawl against the stream along wet strips of filter
  paper, down which water is caused to flow. Most animals, even of the highest groups, tend to react
  in the same way; the energetic swimming of Fishes up-stream being in marked contrast with their
  sluggishness the other way; and every student of pond-life knows how small Crustacea and Rotifers,
  no less than Ciliates, swim away from the inrush of liquid into the dipping-tube, and so evade
  capture. (See Vol. II. p. 216.)</p>

  <p>(iv.) The movements of many Protozoa are affected greatly by <span class="sc">Light</span>.
  These movements have been distinguished into "photopathic," <i>i.e.</i> to or from the
  <i>position</i> of greatest luminosity; and "phototactic," along the <i>direct path</i> of the
  rays.<a id="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Those Protozoa that contain a portion of
  their cytoplasm, known as a "plastid" or "chromatophore" (see pp. <a href="#page36">36</a>, <a
  href="#page39">39</a>), coloured by a green or yellow pigment are usually "phototactic." They
  mostly have at the anterior end a red pigment spot, which serves as an organ of sight, and is
  known as an "eye-spot." In diffused light of low intensity they do not exhibit this reaction, but
  in bright sunlight they rise to the surface and form there a green or yellow scum.</p>

  <p>Most of the colourless Protista are negatively phototactic or photopathic; but those which are
  parasitic on the coloured ones are positively phototactic, like their hosts.</p>

  <p>Here, as in the case of other stimuli,<a id="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> the
  absolute intensity of the light is of importance; for as it increases from a low degree, different
  organisms in turn cease to be stimulated, and <span class="pagenum" id="page22"><span
  class="smaller">{22}</span></span>then are repelled instead of being attracted. The most active
  part of the spectrum in determining reactions of movement are the violet and blue rays of
  wave-length between <span class="wnw">40 &micro;/10</span> and <span class="wnw">49 &micro;/10</span>, while
  the warmer and less refractive half of the spectrum is inert save in so far as it determines
  changes in the temperature of the medium.</p>

  <p>(v.) The movements of many Protozoa are rendered sluggish by cold, and active by a rise of
  <span class="sc">Temperature</span> up to what we may term the "optimum"; the species becomes
  sluggish again as the temperature continues to rise to a certain point when the movements are
  arrested, and the being is said to be in a state of "heat-rigor." Most Protozoa, again, tend to
  move in an unequally heated medium to the position nearest to their respective optimum
  temperature. This is called "thermotaxy." The temperature to which Amoeba is thermotactic is
  recorded as 35&deg; C. (95&deg; F.); that of <i>Paramecium</i> is 28&deg; C. (82&deg; F.).</p>

  <p>(vi.) Most active Protozoa tend to take up a definite position in respect to a current of <span
  class="sc">Electricity</span> passing through the medium, and in the majority of cases, including
  most Ciliates, <i>Amoeba</i>, and <i>Trachelomonas</i>, they orient their long diameters in the
  direction of the lines of force and swim along these to assemble behind the cathode. The
  phenomenon is called "galvanotaxy," and this particular form is "negative." <i>Opalina</i> (Fig.
  41, p. <a href="#page123">123</a>), however, and most Flagellates are "positively galvanotactic,"
  and move towards the anode. H. H. Dale<a id="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> has shown
  that the phenomenon may be possibly in reality a case of chemiotaxy, for the direction of motion
  varies with the nature and concentration of the medium. It would thus be a reaction to the "ion"
  liberated in contact with the one or other extremity of the being. Induction shocks, as we have
  seen, if slight, arrest the movements of Protozoa, or if a little stronger determine movements of
  contraction; if of sufficient intensity they kill them. No observation seems to have been made on
  the behaviour of Protista in an electric field. A magnetic field of the highest intensity appears
  to be indifferent to all Protista.</p>

  <p>(vii.) We have already referred to the effect of dissolved <span class="sc">Chemical
  Substances</span> present in the water. If the substance is in itself not harmful, and the effect
  varies with the concentration, we term the reaction one of "tonotaxy," which combines <span
  class="pagenum" id="page23"><span class="smaller">{23}</span></span>with that of "chemiotaxy" for
  substances that in weak solution are attractive or repellent to the being. <i>Paramecium</i>,
  which feeds on bacteria, organisms of putrefaction, is positively chemiotactic to solutions of
  carbon dioxide, and as it gives this off in its own respiration, it is attracted to its fellows.
  The special case of reaction to gases in solution is termed "aerotaxy," or "pneumotaxy," according
  as the gas is oxygen or carbon dioxide. We find that in this respect there are degrees, so that a
  mixed culture of Flagellates in an organic infusion sorts itself out, under the cover of a
  microscopic preparation, into zones of distinct species, at different distances from the freely
  aerated edge, according to the demands of each species for oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub>
  respectively.</p>

  <p>Finally, we must note that the apparently "spontaneous movements" of Protists can hardly be
  explained as other than due either to <i>external</i> stimuli, such as we have just studied, or to
  <i>internal</i> stimuli, the outcome of internal changes, such as fatigue, hunger, and the like.
  Of the latter kind are the movements that result in <span class="smaller">REPRODUCTION</span>.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Reproduction.</b>&mdash;We have noted above that the growth of an organism
  <i>which retains its shape</i> alters the ratio of the surface area to the whole volume, so
  necessary for the changes involved in life. For the volume of an organism varies as the cube of
  any given diameter, whereas the surface varies with the square only. Without going into the
  arithmetical details, we may say that the ratio of surface to volume is lessened to roughly
  four-fifths of the original ratio when the cell doubles its bulk. As Herbert Spencer and others
  have pointed out, this must reduce the activities of the cell, and the due ratio is restored by
  the division of the cell into two.<a id="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> This accounts
  for what we must look on as the most primitive mode of reproduction, as it is the simplest, and
  which we term "fission" at Spencer's "limit of <span class="pagenum" id="page24"><span
  class="smaller">{24}</span></span>growth." Other modes of reproduction will be studied later (p.
  <a href="#page30">30</a>), after a more detailed inquiry into the structure of the nucleus and of
  its behaviour in cell-division. All cell-division is accompanied by increased waste, and is
  consequently <i>catabolic</i> in character, though the <i>anabolic</i> growth of living
  protoplasm, at the expense of the internal reserves, may be concurrent therewith.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><span class="sc">Cell-Division</span></p>

  <p>In ordinary cases of fission of an isolated cell the cell elongates, and as it does so, like
  other viscid bodies, contracts in the middle, which becomes drawn out into a thread, and finally
  gives way. In some cases (<i>e.g.</i> that of the <i>Amoeba</i>, Fig. 4) the nucleus previously
  undergoes a similar division by simple constriction, which is called direct or "amitotic"
  division. But usually the division of the nucleus prior to cell-division is a more complex
  process, and involves the co-operation of the cytoplasm; and we must now study in detail the
  nucleus and its structure in "rest" and in fission.<a id="NtA_34"
  href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We have noted above (p. <a href="#page6">6</a>, Fig. 2) the structure of the so-called "resting
  nucleus,"<a id="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> when the cell is discharging the
  ordinary functions of its own life, with its wall, network of linin, chromatin-granules, and
  nucleole or nucleoles. The chromatin-granules are most abundant at two periods in the life of the
  cell, (1) when it is young and fresh from division, and (2) at the term of its life, when it is
  itself preparing for division. In the interim they are fewer, smaller, and stain less intensely.
  In many Protista the whole or greater part of the chromatin is densely aggregated into a central
  "nuclein-mass" or <i>karyosome</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page25"><span
  class="smaller">{25}</span></span>suspended in the linin network (long regarded as a mere
  nucleole). Such a nucleus is often termed a "vesicular nucleus".<a id="NtA_36"

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page26"><span class="smaller">{26}</span></span></div>

  <p>When cell-division is about to take place the linin, or at least the greater part of it,
  assumes the character of a number of distinct threads, and the whole of the chromatin granules are
  distributed at even distances along these (Fig. 6, A, B, C), so as to appear like so many strings
  of beads. Each such thread is called a "chromosome." Then each bead divides longitudinally into
  two. The thread flattens into a ribbon, edged by the two lines of chromatin beads. Finally, the
  ribbon splits longitudinally into two single threads of beads (Fig. 6, E). During these changes
  the nucleole or nucleoles diminish, or even disappear, as if they had contributed their matter to
  the growth of the chromatin proper. In Higher Animals and Plants the nuclear wall next disappears,
  and certain structures become obvious, especially in the cytoplasm of Metazoa. Two minute spheres
  of plasm (themselves often showing a concentric structure), the "centrosomes,"<a id="NtA_38"
  href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> which hitherto lay close together at the side of the nuclear
  wall, now separate; but they remain connected by a spindle of clear plasmic threads (Fig. 6, B-E)
  which, as the centres diverge, comes to lie across the spot the nucleus occupied, and now the
  chromosomes lie about the equator of this spindle (Fig. 6, F). Moreover, the surrounding cytoplasm
  shows a radiating structure, diverging from the centrosome, so that spindle and external
  radiations together make up a "strain-figure," like that of the "lines of force" in relation to
  the poles of a magnet. Such we can demonstrate in a plane by spreading or shaking iron filings on
  a piece of paper above the poles of a magnet, or in space by suspending finely divided iron in a
  thick liquid, such as mucilage or glycerin, and bringing the vessel with the mixture into a strong
  magnetic field;<a id="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> the latter mode has the advantage
  <span class="pagenum" id="page27"><span class="smaller">{27}</span></span>of enabling us to watch
  the changes in the distribution of the lines under changing conditions or continued strain.</p>

  <p>The chromosomes are now completely split, each into its two daughter-segments, which glide
  apart (Fig. 7, G, <i>ep</i>), and pass each to its own pole of the spindle, stopping just short of
  the centrosome (I). Thus, on the inner side of either centrosome is found an aggregation of
  daughter-segments, each of which is sister to one at the opposite pole, while the number at either
  pole is identical with that of the segments into which the old nucleus had resolved itself at the
  outset. The daughter-segments shorten and thicken greatly as they diverge to the poles, and on
  their arrival crowd close together.</p>

  <p>A distinct wall now forms around the aggregated <span class="pagenum" id="page28"><span
  class="smaller">{28}</span></span>daughter-chromosomes (J), so as to combine them into a nucleus
  for the daughter-cell. The reorganisation of the young nucleus certainly varies in different
  cases, and has been ill-studied, probably because of the rapidity of the changes that take place.
  The cytoplasm now divides, either tapering into a "waist" which finally ruptures, or constricting
  by the deepening of a narrow annular groove so as to complete the formation and isolation of the
  daughter-cells.</p>

  <p>We might well compare the cell-division to the halving of a pumpkin or melon, of which the
  flesh as a whole is simply divided into two by a transverse cut, while the seeds and the cords
  that suspend them are each singly split to be divided evenly between the two halves of the fruit;
  the flesh would represent the cytoplasm, the cords the linin threads of the nucleus, and the seeds
  the chromatin granules. In this way the halving of the nucleus is much more complete and intimate
  than that of the cytoplasm; and this is the reason why many biologists have been led to regard the
  nuclear segments, and especially their chromatic granules, as the seat of the hereditary
  properties of the cell, properties which have to be equally transmitted on its fission to each
  daughter-cell.<a id="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> But we must remember that the linin
  is also in great part used up in the formation of these segments, like the cords of our supposed
  melon; and it is open to us to regard the halving in this intimate way of the "linin" as the
  essence of the process, and that of the chromatin as accessory, or even as only part of the
  necessary machinery of the process. The halving or direct splitting lengthwise of a viscid thread
  is a most difficult problem from a physical point of view; and it may well be that the chromatin
  granules have at least for a part of their function the facilitation of this process. If such be
  the case, we can easily understand the increase in number, and size and staining power of these
  granules as cell-division approaches, and their atrophy or partial disappearance during their long
  intervening periods of active cell life. Hence we hesitate to accept the views so commonly
  maintained that the chromatin represents a <span class="pagenum" id="page29"><span
  class="smaller">{29}</span></span>"germ-plasm" or "idioplasm" of relatively great persistence,
  which gives the cell its own racial qualities.<a id="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The process we have just examined is called "mitosis," "karyomitosis," or "karyokinesis"; and
  the nucleus is said to undergo "indirect" division, as compared to "direct" division by mere
  constriction. In an intermediate mode, common to many Protista, the nuclear wall persists
  throughout the whole process, though a spindle is constituted within, and chromosomes are formed
  and split: the division of the nucleus takes place, however, by simple constriction, as seen in
  the Filose Rhizopod <i>Euglypha</i> (Fig. 8).</p>

  <p>In many Sarcodina and some Sporozoa the nucleus gives off small fragments into the cytoplasm,
  or is resolved into them; <span class="pagenum" id="page30"><span
  class="smaller">{30}</span></span>they have been termed "chromidia" by E. Hertwig. New nuclei may
  be formed by their growth and coalescence, the original nucleus sometimes disappearing more or
  less completely.</p>

  <p>In certain cases the division of the nucleus is not followed by that of the cytoplasm, so that
  a plurinucleate mass of protoplasm results: this is called an "apocyte"; and we find transitional
  forms between this and the uninucleate or true cell. Thus in one species of <i>Amoeba</i> (<i>A.
  binucleata</i>) there are always two nuclei, which divide simultaneously to provide for the outfit
  of the daughter-cells on fission. Again, we find in some cases that similar multinucleate masses
  may be formed by the union of two or more cells by their cytoplasm only: such a union is termed
  "permanent plastogamy," and the plurinucleate mass a "plasmodium."<a id="NtA_42"
  href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> Here again we find intermediate forms between plasmodium and
  apocyte, for the nuclei of the former may divide and so increase in number, without division of
  the still growing mass. Both kinds of plurinucleate organisms are termed "coenocytes" without
  reference to their mode of origin.</p>

  <p>The rhythm of cell-life that we have just studied is called the "Spencerian" rhythm. Each cell
  in turn grows from half the bulk of its parent at the time it was formed to the full size of that
  parent, when it divides in its own turn. Rest is rare, and assumed only when the cell is exposed
  to such unfavourable external conditions as starvation, drought, etc.; it has no necessary
  relation to fission.</p>

  <p><b>Multiple fission or brood-formation.</b>&mdash;We may now turn to a new rhythm, in strong
  contrast to the former: a cell after having attained a size, often notably greater than its
  parents, divides: without any interval for growth, the daughter-cells again divide, and this may
  be repeated as many as ten times, or even more, so as to give rise to a number of small
  cells&mdash;4, 8, 16&mdash;1024,<a id="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> etc.,
  respectively. Such an assemblage of small cells so formed is called a brood, and well deserves
  this name, for they never separate until the whole series of divisions is completed. By this
  process the number of individuals is rapidly <span class="pagenum" id="page31"><span
  class="smaller">{31}</span></span>increased, hence it has received the name of "sporulation." The
  term spores is especially applied to the reproductive bodies of Cryptogams, such as Mosses, Fungi,
  etc.: the resulting cells are called "spores," "zoospores" if active ("amoebulae" if provided with
  pseudopodia, "flagellulae" if flagellate), "aplanospores," if motionless. We prefer to call them
  by the general term "brood-cells," the original cell the "brood-mother-cell," and the process,
  "multiple fission" or "brood-formation." As noted, the brood-mother-cell usually attains an
  exceptionally large size, and it in most cases passes into a state of rest before entering on
  division: thus brood-formation is frequently the ultimate term of a long series of Spencerian
  divisions. Two contrasting periods of brood-formation may occur in the life cycle of some beings,
  notably the Sporozoa.<a id="NtA_44" href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Colonial union.</b>&mdash;In certain cases, the brood-cells instead of separating remain
  together to form a "colony"; and this may enlarge itself again by binary division of its
  individual cells at their limit of growth. Here, certain or all of the cells may (either after
  separation, or in their places) undergo brood-formation: such cells are often termed "reproductive
  cells" in contrast with the "colonial cells."</p>

  <p>Some such colonial Protista must have been the starting-points for the Higher Animals and
  Plants; probably apocytial Protista were the starting-points of the Fungi. In the Higher Animals
  and Plants, the spermatozoa and the oospheres (the male and female pairing-cells) are alike the
  offspring of brood-formation: and the coupled-cell (fertilised egg) starts its new life by
  <i>segmentation</i>, which is a brood-formation in which the cells do not separate, but remain in
  colonial union, to differentiate in due course into the tissue-cells of the organism.</p>

  <p><b>Retarded brood-formation.</b>&mdash;The nuclear divisions may alternate with cell-divisions,
  as above stated, or the former may be <span class="pagenum" id="page32"><span
  class="smaller">{32}</span></span>completed before the cytoplasm divides; thus the
  brood-mother-cell becomes temporarily an apocyte,<a id="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>
  which is then <i>resolved</i> simultaneously into the 1-nucleate brood-cells.</p>

  <p>A temporary apocytial condition is often passed through in the formation of the brood of cells
  by repeated divisions without any interval for enlargement; for the nuclear divisions may go on
  more rapidly than those of the cytoplasm, or be completed before any cell-division takes place
  (Figs. 31, 34, 35, pp. <a href="#page95">95</a>, <a href="#page101">101</a>, <a
  href="#page104">104</a>), the nuclear process being "accelerated" or the cytoplastic being
  "retarded," whichever we prefer to say and to hold. Thus as many as thirty-two nuclei may have
  been formed by repeated binary subdivisions before any division of the cytoplasm takes place to
  resolve the apocyte into true 1-nucleate cells.</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p>In many cases of brood-formation the greater part of the food-supply of the brood-mother-cell
    has been stored as reserve-products, which accumulate in quantity in the cell; this is notably
    seen in the ovum or egg of the Higher Animals. How great such an accumulation may be is indeed
    well seen in the enormous yolk of a bird's egg, gorged as it were to repletion. When a cell has
    entered on such course of "miserly" conduct, it may lose all power of drawing on its own
    supplies, and finally that of accumulating more, and passes into the state of "rest." To resume
    activity there is needed either a change in the internal conditions&mdash;demanding the lapse of
    time&mdash;or in the external conditions, or in both.<a id="NtA_46"
    href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> We may call this resumption "germination."</p>
    <p class="sp0">Very often in the study of a large and complex organism we are able to find
    processes in action on a large scale which, depending as they must do on the protoplasmic
    activities of its individual cells, reveal the nature of similar processes in simple unicellular
    beings: such a clue to the utilisation of reserves by a cell which has gorged itself with them
    so as to pass into a state of rest is to be found in that common multicellular organism, the
    Potato. This stores up reserves in its underground stems (tubers); if we plant these immediately
    on the completion of their growth, they will not start at once, even under what would outwardly
    seem to be most appropriate conditions. A certain lapse of time is an essential factor for
    sprouting. It would appear that in the Potato the starch can only be digested by a definite
    ferment, which does not exist when it is dug, but which is only formed very slowly, and not at
    all until a certain time has supervened; and that sprouting can only <span class="pagenum"
    id="page33"><span class="smaller">{33}</span></span>take place when soluble material has been
    provided in this way for the growth of the young shoots. We have also reason to believe that
    these ferments are only formed by the degradation of the protoplasm itself. Now obviously this
    degradation must be very slow in a resting organism; and any external stimulus that will tend to
    protoplasmic activity will thereby tend to form at the same time the digestive ferments and
    dissolve the stored supplies, to render them available for the life-growth and reproduction of
    the being. We now see why inactive "miserly" cells so often pass into a resting state before
    dividing, and why they go on dividing again and again when once they re-enter upon an active
    life, the living protoplasm growing at the expense of the reserves.<a id="NtA_47"
    href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> Resting cells of this type occur of course only at relatively
    rare intervals in the animal-feeding Protozoa, that have to take into their substance the food
    they require for their growth and life-work, and cannot therefore store up much reserves. For
    they are constantly producing in the narrow compass of their body those very ferments that would
    dissolve the reserves when formed. Internal parasites and "saprophytes," that is, beings which
    live on dead and decayed organic matter, on the other hand, live surrounded by a supply of
    dissolved food; and rarely do we find larger cells, richer in reserves, than in the parasitic
    Sporozoa, which owe their name to the importance of brood-formation in their life-history. In
    Radiolaria (p. <a href="#page75">75</a> f.) a central capsule separates off an inner layer of
    protoplasm; the outer layer is the one in which digestion is performed, while the inner layer
    stores up reserves; and here brood-formation appears to be the rule. But the largest cells of
    all are the eggs of the Metazoa, which in reality lead a parasitic life, being nurtured by the
    animal as a whole, and contributing nothing to the welfare of it as an individual. Their
    activity is reduced to a minimum, and the consequent need for a high ratio of surface to volume
    is also reduced, which accounts for their inordinate size. But directly the reserve materials
    are rendered available by the formation of a digestive ferment, then protoplasmic growth takes
    place, and the need for an extended surface is felt; cell-division follows cell-division with
    scarcely an interval in the process of segmentation.</p>

  <p><b>Syngamy.</b><a id="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>&mdash;The essence of typical
  syngamy is, that two cells ("pairing-cells," "gametes") of the same species approach one another,
  and fuse, cytoplasm with cytoplasm, and nucleus with nucleus, to form a new cell ("coupled-cell,"
  "zygote "). This process is called also "conjugation" or "cytogamy." In the simplest cases the two
  cells are equal and attract one another equally ("isogamy"), and have frequently the character of
  zoospores.</p>

  <p>In an intermediate type, the one cell is larger and more sluggish (female), "megagamete,"
  "oogamete," "oosphere," "egg"; the other smaller, more active (male), "microgamete,"
  "spermogamete," "spermatozoon," "sperm"; and in the most specialised <span class="pagenum"
  id="page34"><span class="smaller">{34}</span></span>cases which prevail among the Higher Animals
  and Plants, the larger cell is motionless, and the smaller is active, ciliate, flagellate, or
  amoeboid: the coupled-cell or zygote is here termed the "oosperm."<a id="NtA_49"
  href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> It encysts immediately in most Protista except Infusoria,
  Acystosporidae, Haemosporidae, and Trypanosomatidae.</p>

  <p>As the size of the two gametes is so disproportionate in most cases that the oosphere may be
  millions of times bigger than the sperm, and the latter at its entrance into the oosphere entirely
  escape unaided vision, the term "egg" is applied in lax speech, both (1) to the female cell, and
  (2) to the oosperm, the latter being distinguished as the "fertilised egg," a survival from the
  time when the union of <i>two</i> cells, as the essence of the process, was not understood.</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp3">
    <p>We know that in <i>many</i> cases, and have a right to infer that in <i>all</i>, chemiotaxy
    plays an important part in attracting the pairing-cells to one another. In Mammals and
    Sauropsida there seems also to be a rheotactic action of the cilia lining the oviducts, which
    work downwards, and so induce the sperms to swim upwards to meet the ovum, a condition of things
    that was most puzzling until the nature of rheotaxy was understood. A remarkable fact is that
    equal gametes rarely appear to be attracted by members of the same brood, though they are
    attracted by those of any other brood of the same species.<a id="NtA_50"
    href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> It may well be that each brood has its own characteristic
    secretion, or "smell," as it were, slightly different from that of other broods, just as every
    dog has his, so easily recognisable by other dogs; and that the cells only react to different
    "smells" to their own. Such a secretion from the surface of the female cell would lessen its
    surface tension, and thereby render easier the penetration of the sperm into its substance.</p>
    <p class="sp0">As a rule, one at least of the pair-cells is fresh from division, and it would
    thus appear that the union of the nuclei is facilitated when one at least of them is a "young"
    one. Of the final mechanism of the union of the nuclei, we know nothing: they may unite in any
    of the earlier phases of mitosis, or even in the "resting state." A fibrillation of the
    cytoplasm during the process, radiating around a centrosome or two centrosomes indicates a
    strained condition.<a id="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Regeneration.</b>&mdash;Finally, experiments have been made by several observers as to the
  effects of removing parts of Protozoa, to see how far regeneration can take place. The chief
  results are as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">1. A nucleated portion may regenerate <i>completely</i>, if of sufficient size.
  Consequently, multinucleate forms, such as <i>Actinosphaerium</i> (Heliozoa, Fig. 19, p. <a
  href="#page72">72</a>), may be cut into a number of fragments, and regenerate completely. In
  Ciliata, such as <i>Stentor</i> (Fig. 59, p. <a href="#page156">156</a>), each fragment must
  possess a portion of the meganucleus, and at least one micronucleus (p. <a
  href="#page145">145</a>), and, moreover, must possess a certain minimum size. A Radiolarian
  "central-capsule" (p. <a href="#page75">75</a>) with its endoplasm and nucleus may regenerate its
  ectoplasm, but the isolated ectoplasm being non-nucleate is doomed. A "central capsule" of one
  species introduced into the ectoplasm of another, closely allied, did well. All non-nucleate
  pieces may exhibit characteristic movements, but appear unable to digest; and they survive only a
  short time.<a id="NtA_52" href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><span class="sc">"Animals" and "Plants"</span></p>

  <p>Hitherto we have discussed the cell as if it were everywhere an organism that takes in food
  into its substance, the food being invariably "organic" material, formed by or for other cells;
  such nutrition is termed "holozoic." There are, however, limits to the possibilities in this
  direction, as there are to the fabled capacities of the Scillonians of gaining their precarious
  livelihood by taking in one another's washing. For part of the food material taken in in this way
  is applied to the supply of the energies of the cell, and is consequently split up or oxidised
  into simpler, more stable bodies, no longer fitted for food; and of the matter remaining to be
  utilised for building up the organism, a certain proportion is always wasted in by-products.
  Clearly, then, the supply of food under such conditions is continually lessening in the universe,
  and we have to seek for a manufactory of food-material from inorganic materials: this is to be
  found in those cells that are known as "vegetal," in the widest sense of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page36"><span class="smaller">{36}</span></span>the word. In this, sense, vegetal nutrition is
  the utilisation of nitrogenous substances that are more simple than proteids or peptones, together
  with suitable organic carbon compounds, etc., to build up proteids and protoplasm. The simplest of
  organisms with a vegetal nutrition are the Schizomycetes, often spoken of loosely as "bacteria" or
  "microbes," in which the differentiation of cytoplasm and nucleus is not clearly recognisable.
  Some of these can build up their proteids from the free uncombined nitrogen of the atmosphere,
  carbon dioxide, and inorganic salts, such as sulphates and phosphates. But the majority of vegetal
  feeders require the nitrogen to be combined at least in the form of a nitrate or an ammonium
  salt&mdash;nay, for growth in the dark, they require the carbon also to be present in some organic
  combination, such as a tartrate, a carbohydrate, etc. Acetates and oxalates, "aromatic"
  compounds<a id="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> and nitriles are rarely capable of being
  utilised, and indeed are often prejudicial to life. In many vegetal feeders certain portions of
  the protoplasm are specialised, and have the power of forming a green, yellow, or brown pigment;
  these are called "plastids" or "chromatophores." They multiply by constriction within the cell,
  displaying thereby a certain independent individuality. These plastids have in presence of light
  the extraordinary power of deoxidising carbon dioxide and water to form carbohydrates (or fats,
  etc.) and free oxygen; and from these carbohydrates or fats, together with ammonium salts or
  nitrates, etc., the vegetal protoplasm at large can build up all necessary food matter. So that in
  presence of light of the right quality<a id="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> and
  adequate intensity, such coloured vegetal beings have the capacity for building up their bodies
  and reserves from purely inorganic materials. Coloured vegetal nutrition, then, is a process
  involving the absorption of energy; the source from which this is derived in the bacteria being
  very obscure at present. Nutrition by means of coloured plastids is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page37"><span class="smaller">{37}</span></span>distinguished as "holophytic," and that from
  lower substances, which, however, contain organically combined carbon, as "saprophytic," for such
  are formed by the death and decomposition of living beings. The third mode of nutrition (found in
  some bacteria) from wholly inorganic substances, including free nitrogen, has received no
  technical name. All three modes are included in the term "autotrophic" (self-nourishing).</p>

  <p>Vegetal feeders have a great tendency to accumulate reserves in insoluble forms, such as
  starch, paramylum, and oil-globules on the one hand, and pyrenoids, proteid crystals, aleurone
  granules on the other.</p>

  <p>When an animal-feeding cell encysts or surrounds itself with a continuous membrane, this is
  always of nitrogenous composition, usually containing the glucosamide "chitin." The vegetal
  cell-wall, on the contrary, usually consists, at least primarily, of the carbohydrate
  "cellulose"&mdash;the vegetal cell being richly supplied with carbohydrate reserves, and drawing
  on them to supply the material for its garment. This substance is what we are all familiar with in
  cotton or tissue-paper.</p>

  <p>Again, not only is the vegetal cell very ready to surround itself with a cell-wall, but its
  food-material, or rather, speaking accurately, the inorganic materials from which that food is to
  be manufactured, may diffuse through this wall with scarcely any difficulty. Such a cell can and
  does grow when encysted: it grows even more readily in this state, since none of its energies are
  absorbed by the necessities of locomotion, etc. Growth leads, of course, to division: there is
  often an economy of wall-material by the formation of a mere party-wall dividing the cavity of the
  old cell-wall at its limit of growth into two new cavities of equal size. Thus the division tends
  to form a colonial aggregate, which continues to grow in a motionless, and, so far, a "resting"
  state. We may call this "vegetative rest," to distinguish it from "absolute rest," when all other
  life-processes (as well as motion) are reduced to a minimum or absolutely suspended.</p>

  <p>The cells of a plant colony are usually connected by very fine threads of protoplasm, passing
  through minute pores where the new party-wall is left incomplete after cell-division.<a
  id="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> In a few plants, such as most Fungi, the
  cell-partitions are <span class="pagenum" id="page38"><span class="smaller">{38}</span></span>in
  abeyance for the most part, and there is formed an apocyte with a continuous investment,
  sometimes, however, chambered at intervals by partitions between multinucleate units of
  protoplasm. We started with a purely <i>physiological</i> consideration, and we have now arrived
  at a <i>morphological</i> distinction, very valid among higher organisms.</p>

  <p><i><span class="sc">Higher Plants</span> consist of cells for the most part each isolated in
  its own cell-cavity, save for the few slender threads of communication.</i></p>

  <p><i><span class="sc">Higher Animals</span> consist of cells that are rarely isolated in this
  way, but are mostly in mutual contact over the greater part of their surface.</i></p>

  <p>Again, Plants take in either food or else the material for food in solution through their
  surface, and only by diffusion through the cell-wall. Insectivorous Plants that have the power of
  capturing and digesting insects have no real internal cavity. Animal-feeding Protista take in
  their food into the interior of their protoplasm and digest it therein, and the Metazoa have an
  internal cavity or stomach for the same purpose. Here again there are exceptions in the case of
  certain internal parasites, such as the Tapeworms and Acanthocephala (Vol. II. pp. 74, 174), which
  have no stomachs, living as they do in the dissolved food-supplies of their hosts, but still
  possessing the general tissues and organs of Metazoa.</p>

  <p>Corresponding with the absence of mouth, and the <i>absorption</i> instead of the
  <i>prehension</i> of food, we find that the <i>movements</i> of plant-beings are limited. In the
  higher Plants, and many lower ones, the colonial organism is firmly fixed or attached, and the
  movements of its parts are confined to flexions. These are produced by inequalities of growth; or
  by inequalities of temporary distension of cell-masses, due to the absorption of liquid into their
  vacuoles, while relaxation is effected by the cytoplasm and cell-wall becoming pervious to the
  liquid. We find no case of a differentiation of the cytoplasm within the cell into definite
  muscular fibrils. In the lower Plants single naked motile cells disseminate the species; and the
  pairing-cells, or at least the males, have the same motile character. In higher Cryptogams,
  Cycads, and <i>Ginkgo</i> (the Maiden-hair Tree), the sperms alone are free-swimming; and as we
  pass to Flowering Plants, the migratory character of the male cells is restricted to the smallest
  limits. <span class="pagenum" id="page39"><span class="smaller">{39}</span></span>though never
  wholly absent. Intracellular movements of the protoplasm are, however, found in all Plants.</p>

  <p>In Plants we find no distinct nervous system formed of cells and differentiated from other
  tissues with centres and branches and sense-organs. These are more or less obvious in all Metazoa,
  traces being even found in the Sponges.</p>

  <p>We may then define Plants as beings which have the power of manufacturing true food-stuffs from
  lower chemical substances than proteids, often with the absorption of energy. They have the power
  of surrounding themselves with a cell-wall, usually of cellulose, and of growing and dividing
  freely in this state, in which animal-like changes of form and locomotion are impossible; their
  colonies are almost always fixed or floating; free locomotion is only possible in the case of
  their naked reproductive cells, and is transitory even in these. The movements of motile parts of
  complex plant-organisms are due to the changes in the osmotic powers of cells as a whole, and not
  to the contraction of differentiated fibrils in the cytoplasm of individual cells. Plants that can
  form carbohydrates with liberation of free oxygen have always definite plastids coloured with a
  lipochrome<a id="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> pigment, or else (in the
  Phycochromaceae) the whole plasma is so coloured. Solid food is never taken into the free
  plant-cell nor into an internal cavity in complex Plants. If, as in insectivorous Plants, it is
  digested and absorbed, it is always in contact with the morphological external surface. In the
  complex Plants apocytes and syncytes are rare&mdash;the cells being each invested with its own
  wall, and, at most, only communicating by minute threads with its neighbours. No trace of a
  central nervous system with differentiated connexions can be made out.</p>

  <p>Animals all require proteid food; their cyst-walls are never formed of cellulose; their cells
  usually divide in the naked condition only, or if encysted, no secondary party-walls are formed
  between the daughter-cells to unite them into a vegetative colony. Their colonies are usually
  locomotive, or, if fixed, their parts largely retain their powers of relative motion, and are
  often provided on their free surfaces with cilia or flagella; and many cells have differentiated
  in their cytoplasm contractile muscular fibrils. Their food (except in a few parasitic groups) is
  always taken <span class="pagenum" id="page40"><span class="smaller">{40}</span></span>into a
  distinct digestive cavity. A complex nervous system, of many special cells, with branched
  prolongations interlacing or anastomosing, and uniting superficial sense-organs with internal
  centres, is universally developed in Metazoa. All Metazoa fulfil the above conditions.</p>

  <p>But when we turn to the Protozoa we find that many of the characters evade us. There are some
  Dinoflagellates (see p. <a href="#page130">130</a>) which have coloured plastids, but which differ
  in no other respect (even specific) from others that lack them: the former may have mouths which
  are functionless, the latter have functional mouths. Some colourless Flagellates are saprophytic
  and absorb nutritive liquids, such as decomposing infusions of organic matter, possibly free from
  all proteid constituents; while others, scarcely different, take in food after the fashion of
  Amoeba. Sporozoa in the persistence of the encysted stage are very plant-like, though they are
  often intracellular and are parasitic in living Animals. On the other hand, the Infusoria for the
  most part answer to all the physiological characters of the Animal world, but are single cells,
  and by the very perfection of their structure, all due to plasmic not to cellular differentiation,
  show that they lie quite off the possible track of the origin of Metazoa from Protozoa. Indeed, a
  strong natural line of demarcation lies between Metazoa and Protista. Of the Protozoa, certain
  groups, like the Foraminifera and Radiolaria and the Ciliate and Suctorial Infusoria are
  distinctly animal in their chemical activities or metabolism, their mode of nutrition, and their
  locomotive powers. When we turn to the Proteomyxa, Mycetozoa, and the Flagellates we find that the
  distinction between these and the lower Fungi is by no means easy, the former passing, indeed,
  into true Fungi by the Chytridieae, which it is impossible to separate sharply from those
  Flagellates and Proteomyxa which Cienkowsky and Zopf have so accurately studied under the name of
  "Monadineae." Again, many of the coloured Flagellates can only (if at all) be distinguished from
  Plants by the relatively greater prominence and duration of the mobile state, though classifiers
  are generally agreed in allotting to Plants those coloured Flagellates which in the resting state
  assume the form of multicellular or apocytial filaments or plates.</p>

  <p class="sp5">On these grounds we should agree with Haeckel in distinguishing the living world
  into the Metazoa, or Higher Animals, which <span class="pagenum" id="page41"><span
  class="smaller">{41}</span></span>are sharply marked off; the Metaphyta, or Higher Plants, which
  it is not so easy to characterise, but which unite at least two or more vegetal characters; and
  the Protista, or organisms, whose differentiation is limited to that within the cell (or apocyte),
  and does not involve the cells as units of tissues. These Protista, again, it is impossible to
  separate into animal and vegetal so sharply as to treat adequately of either group without
  including some of the other: thus it is that every text-book on Zoology, like the present work,
  treats of certain Protophyta. The most unmistakably animal group of the Protista, the Ciliata, is,
  as we have seen, by the complex differentiation of its protoplasm, widely removed from the Metazoa
  with their relatively simple cells but differentiated cell-groups and tissues. The line of
  probable origin of the Metazoa is to be sought, for Sponges at least, among the Choanoflagellates
  (pp. <a href="#page121">121</a> f. <a href="#page181">181</a> f.).</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><span class="sc">The Question of Spontaneous
  Generation</span></p>

  <p>From the first discovery of the Protozoa, their life-history has been the subject of the
  highest interest: yet it is only within our own times that we can say that the questions of their
  origin and development have been thoroughly worked out. If animal or vegetable matter of any kind
  be macerated in water, filtered, or even distilled, various forms of Protista make their
  appearance; and frequently, as putrefaction advances, form after form makes its appearance,
  becomes abundant, and then disappears to be replaced by other species. The questions suggested by
  such phenomena are these: (1) Do the Protista arise spontaneously, that is, by the direct
  organisation into living beings of the chemical substances present, as a crystal is organised from
  a solution: (2) Are the forms of the Protista constant from one generation to another, as are
  ordinary birds, beasts, and fishes?</p>

  <p>The question of the "spontaneous generation" of the Protista was readily answered in the
  affirmative by men who believed that Lice bred directly from the filth of human skins and
  clothes;<a id="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> and that Blow-flies, to say nothing of
  Honey-bees, arose in rotten flesh: but the bold aphorism of Harvey "omne vivum ex ovo" at once
  gained the ear of the best-inspired men of science, and set them to work in search of the "eggs"
  that gave rise to the organisms of putrefaction. Redi (ob. 1699) showed that Blow-flies never
  arise save when other Blow-flies gain access to meat and deposit their very visible eggs thereon.
  Leeuwenhoek, his <span class="pagenum" id="page43"><span
  class="smaller">{43}</span></span>contemporary, in the latter half of the seventeenth century
  adduced strong reasons for ascribing the origin of the organisms of putrefaction to invisible
  air-borne eggs. L. Joblot and H. Baker in the succeeding half-century investigated the matter, and
  showed that putrefaction was no necessary antecedent of the appearance of these beings: that, as
  well as being air-borne, the germs might sometimes have adhered to the materials used for making
  the infusion; and that no organisms were found if the infusions were boiled long enough, and
  corked when still boiling. These views were strenuously opposed by Needham in England, by Wrisberg
  in Germany, and by Buffon, the great French naturalist and philosopher, whose genius, unballasted
  by an adequate knowledge of facts, often played him sad tricks. Spallanzani made a detailed study
  of what we should now term the "bionomical" or "oecological" conditions of Protistic life and
  reproduction in a manner worthy of modern scientific research, and not attained by some who took
  the opposite side within living recollection. He showed that infusions kept sufficiently long at
  the boiling-point in hermetically sealed vessels developed no Protistic life. As he had shown that
  active Protists are killed at much lower temperatures, he inferred that the germs must have much
  higher powers of resistance; and, by modifying the details of his experiments, he was able to meet
  various objections of Needham.</p>

  <p>Despite this good work, the advocates of spontaneous generation were never really silenced; and
  the widespread belief in the inconstancy of species in Protista added a certain amount of
  credibility to their cause. In 1845 Pineau put forward these views most strongly; and from 1858 to
  1864 they were supported by the elder Pouchet. Louis Pasteur, who began life as a chemist, was led
  from a study of alcoholic fermentation to that of the organisms of fermentation and of
  putrefaction and disease. He showed that in infusions boiled sufficiently long and sealed while
  boiling, or kept at the boiling-point in a sealed vessel, no life manifested itself: objections
  raised on the score of the lack of access of fresh air were met by the arrangement, so commonly
  used in "pure cultures" at the present day, of a flask with a tube attached plugged with a little
  cotton-wool, or even merely bent repeatedly into a zigzag. The former attachment filtered off all
  germs or floating solid particles from the air, the latter brought about the settling of such
  particles in the elbows <span class="pagenum" id="page44"><span
  class="smaller">{44}</span></span>or on the sides of the tube: in neither case did living
  organisms appear, even after the lapse of months. Other observers succeeded in showing that the
  forms and characters of species were as constant as in Higher Animals and Plants, allowing, of
  course, for such regular metamorphoses as occur in Insects, or alternations of generations
  paralleled in Tapeworms and Polypes. The regular sequences of such alternations and metamorphoses
  constitute, indeed, a strong support of the "germ-theory"&mdash;the view that all Protista arise
  from pre-existing germs. It is to the Rev. W. H. Dallinger and the late Dr. Charles Drysdale that
  we owe the first complete records of such complex life-histories in the Protozoa as are presented
  by the minute Flagellates which infest putrefying liquids (see below, p. <a
  href="#page116">116</a> f.). The still lower Schizomycetes, the "microbes" of common speech, have
  also been proved by the labours of Ferdinand Cohn, von Koch, and their numerous disciples, to have
  the same specific constancy in consecutive generations, as we now know, thanks to the methods
  first devised by De Bary for the study of Fungi, and improved and elaborated by von Koch and his
  school of bacteriologists.</p>

  <p class="sp3">And so to-day the principle "omne vivum ex <i>vivo</i>" is universally accepted by
  men of science. Of the ultimate origin of organic life from inorganic life we have not the
  faintest inkling. If it took place in the remote past, it has not been accomplished to the
  knowledge of man in the history of scientific experience, and does not seem likely to be fulfilled
  in the immediate or even in the proximate future.<a id="NtA_58"

  <p>This definition, as we have seen, excludes Metazoa (including Mesozoa, Vol. II. p. 92) sharply
  from Protozoa, but leaves an uncertain boundary on the botanical side; and, as systematists share
  with nations the desire to extend their sphere of influence, we shall here follow the lead of
  other zoologists and include many beings that every botanist would claim for his own realm. Our
  present knowledge of the Protozoa has indeed been largely extended by botanists,<a id="NtA_60"
  href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> while the study of protoplasmic physiology has only passed from
  their fostering care into the domain of General Biology within the last decade. The study of the
  Protozoa is little more than two centuries old, dating from the school of microscopists of whom
  the Dutchman Leeuwenhoek is the chief representative: and we English may feel a just pride in the
  fact that his most important publications are to be found in the early records of our own Royal
  Society.</p>

  <p>Baker, in the eighteenth century, and the younger Wallich, Carter, Dallinger and Drysdale,
  Archer, Saville Kent, Lankester, and Huxley, in the last half-century, are our most illustrious
  names. In France, Joblot, almost as an amateur, like our own Baker, flourished in the early part
  of the eighteenth century. Dujardin in the middle of the same century by his study of protoplasm,
  or sarcode as he termed it, did a great work in laying the foundations of our present ideas, while
  Balbiani, Georges Pouchet, Fabre-Domergue, Maupas, L&eacute;ger, and Labb&eacute; in France, have worthily
  continued and extended the Gallic traditions of exact observation and careful deduction. Otto
  Friedrich M&uuml;ller, the Dane, in the eighteenth century, was a pioneer in the exact study and
  description of a large number of forms of these, as of other microscopic forms of life. The Swiss
  collaborators, Clapar&egrave;de and Lachmann, in the middle of the nineteenth century, added many facts
  and many descriptions; and illustrated them by most valuable figures of the highest merit from
  every point of view. Germany, with her large population of students and her numerous universities,
  has given many names to our list; among these, Ehrenberg and von Stein have added <span
  class="pagenum" id="page46"><span class="smaller">{46}</span></span>the largest number of species
  to the roll. Ehrenberg about 1840 described, indeed, an enormous number of forms with much care,
  and in detail far too elaborate for the powers of the microscope of that date: so that he was led
  into errors, many and grave, which he never admitted down to the close of a long and honoured
  life. Max Schultze did much good work on the Protozoa, as well as on the tissues of the Metazoa,
  and largely advanced our conceptions of protoplasm. His work was continued in Germany by Ernst
  Haeckel, who systematised our knowledge of the Radiolaria, Greeff, Richard Hertwig, Fritz
  Schaudinn, and especially B&uuml;tschli, who contributed to Bronn's <i>Thier-Reich</i> a monograph of
  monumental conception and scope, and of admirable execution, on which we have freely drawn.
  Cienkowsky, a Russian, and James-Clark and Leidy, both Americans, have made contributions of high
  quality.</p>

  <p>Lankester's article in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> was of epoch-making quality in its
  philosophical breadth of thought.</p>

  <p>Delage and H&eacute;rouard have given a full account of the Protozoa in their <i>Trait&eacute; de Zoologie
  Concr&egrave;te</i>, vol. i. (1896); and A. Lang's monograph in his <i>Vergleichende Anatomie</i>, 2nd
  ed. (1901), contains an admirable analysis of their general structure, habits, and life-cycles,
  together with full descriptions of well-selected types. Calkins has monographed "The Protozoa" in
  the Columbia University Biological series (1901). These works of B&uuml;tschli, Delage, Lang, and
  Calkins contain full bibliographies. Doflein has published a most valuable systematic review of
  the Protozoa parasitic on animals under the title <i>Die Protozoen als Parasiten und
  Krankheitserreger</i> (1901); and Schaudinn's <i>Archiv f&uuml;r Protistenkunde</i>, commenced only
  four years ago, already forms an indispensable collection of facts and views.</p>

  <p>The <b>protoplasm</b> of the Protozoa (see p. <a href="#page5">5</a> f.) varies greatly in
  consistency and in differentiation. Its outer layer may be granular and scarcely altered in
  Proteomyxa, the true Myxomycetes, Filosa, Heliozoa, Radiolaria, Foraminifera, etc.; it is clear
  and glassy in the Lobose Rhizopods and the Acrasieae; it is continuous with a firm but delicate
  superficial pellicle of membranous character in most Flagellates and Infusoria; and this pellicle
  may again be consolidated and locally thickened in some members of both groups so as to form a
  coat of mail, even with definite spines and hardened polygonal plates (<i>Coleps</i>, Fig. 54,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page47"><span class="smaller">{47}</span></span>p. <a
  href="#page150">150</a>). Again, it may form transitory or more or less permanent pseudopodia,<a
  id="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> (1) blunt or tapering and distinct, with a hyaline
  outer layer, or (2) granular and pointed, radiating and more or less permanent, or (3) branching
  and fusing where they meet into networks or perforated membranes. Cilia or flagella are motile
  thread-like processes of active protoplasm which perforate the pellicle; they may be combined into
  flattened platelets or firm rods, or transformed into coarse bristles or fine motionless
  sense-hairs. The skeletons of the Protozoa, foreign to the cytoplasm, will be treated of under the
  several groups.</p>

  <p>Most of the fresh-water and brackish forms (and some marine ones) possess one or more
  contractile vacuoles, often in relation to a more or less complex system of spaces or canals in
  Flagellates and Ciliates.</p>

  <p>The <b>Geographical Distribution</b> of Protozoa is remarkable for the wide, nay cosmopolitan,
  distribution of the terrestrial and fresh-water forms;<a id="NtA_62"
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> they owe this to their power of forming cysts, within which they
  resist drought, and can be disseminated as "dust." Very few of them can multiply at a temperature
  approaching freezing-point; the Dinoflagellates can, however, and therefore present Alpine and
  Arctic forms. The majority breed most freely at summer temperatures; and, occurring in small
  pools, can thus achieve their full development in such as are heated by the sun during the long
  Arctic day as readily as in the Tropics. In infusions of decaying matter, the first to appear are
  those that feed on bacteria, the essential organisms of putrefaction. These, again, are quickly
  followed and preyed upon by carnivorous species, which prefer liquids less highly charged with
  organic matters, and do not appear until the liquid, hitherto cloudy, has begun to clear. Thus we
  have rather to do with "habitat" than with "geographical <span class="pagenum" id="page48"><span
  class="smaller">{48}</span></span>distribution," just as with the fresh-water Turbellaria and the
  Rotifers (vol. ii. pp. 4 f., 226 f.). We can distinguish in fresh-water, as in marine Protista,
  "littoral" species living near the bank, among the weeds; "plankton," floating at or near the
  surface; "zonal" species dwelling at various depths; and "bottom-dwellers," mostly "limicolous"
  (or "sapropelic," as Lauterborn terms them), and to be found among the bottom ooze. Many species
  are "epiphytic" or "epizoic," dwelling on plants or animals, and sometimes choice enough in their
  preference of a single genus or species as host. Others again are "moss-dwellers," living among
  the root-hairs of mosses and the like, or even "terrestrial" and inhabiting damp earth. The
  Sporozoa are internal parasites of animals, and so are many Flagellates, while many Proteomyxa are
  parasitic in plant-cells. The Foraminifera (with the exception of most Allogromidiaceae) are
  marine, and so are the Radiolaria; while most Heliozoa inhabit fresh water. Concerning the
  distribution in time we shall speak under the last two groups, the only ones whose skeletons have
  left fossil remains.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;The classification of the Protozoa is no easy task. We
  omit here, for obvious reasons, the unmistakable Plant Protists that have a holophytic or
  saprophytic nutrition; that are, with the exception of a short period of locomotion in the young
  reproductive cells, permanently surrounded with a wall of cellulose or fungus-cellulose, and that
  multiply and grow freely in this encysted state: to these consequently we relegate the <span
  class="sc">Chytridieae</span>, which  so closely allied to the Proteomyxa and the Phycomycetous
  Fungi; and the Confervaceae, which in the resting state form tubular or flattened aggregates and
  are allied to the green Flagellates; besides the Schizophyta. At the opposite pole stand the <span
  class="sc">Infusoria</span> in the strict sense, with the most highly differentiated organisation
  found in our group, culminating in the possession of a nuclear apparatus with nuclei of two kinds,
  and exhibiting a peculiar form of conjugation, in which the nuclear apparatus is reorganised. The
  <span class="sc">Sporozoa</span> are clearly marked off as parasites in living animals, which
  mostly begin life as sickle-shaped cells and have always at least two alternating modes of
  brood-formation, the first giving rise to aplanospores, wherein is formed the second brood of
  sickle-shaped, wriggling zoospores. The remainder, comprising the <span
  class="sc">Sarcodina</span>, or <span class="sc">Rhizopoda</span> in the old wide sense (including
  all <span class="pagenum" id="page49"><span class="smaller">{49}</span></span>that move by
  pseudopodia during the great part of their active life), and the <span
  class="sc">Flagellata</span> in the widest sense, are not easy to split up; for many of the former
  have flagellate reproductive cells, and many of the latter can emit pseudopodia with or without
  the simultaneous retraction of their flagella. The <span class="sc">Radiolaria</span> are well
  defined by the presence in the body plasm of a central capsule marking it off into a central and a
  peripheral portion, the former containing the nucleus, the latter emitting the pseudopodia. Again,
  on the other hand, we find that we can separate as <span class="sc">Flagellata</span> in the
  strict sense the not very natural assemblage of those Protista that have flagella as their
  principle organs of movement or nutrition during the greater part of their active life. The
  remaining groups (which with the Radiolaria compose the Sarcodina of B&uuml;tschli), are the most
  difficult to treat. The <span class="sc">Rhizopoda</span>, as we shall limit them, are naked or
  possess a simple shell, never of calcium carbonate, have pseudopodia that never radiate abundantly
  nor branch freely, nor coalesce to form plasmatic networks, nor possess an axial rod of firmer
  substance. The <span class="sc">Foraminifera</span> have a shell, usually of calcium carbonate,
  their pseudopodia are freely reticulated, at least towards the base; and (with the exception of a
  few simple forms) all are marine. The <span class="sc">Mycetozoa</span> are clearly united by
  their tendency to aggregate more or less completely into complex resting-groups (fructifications),
  and by reproducing by unicellular zoospores, flagellate or amoeboid, which are not known to pair.
  The <span class="sc">Heliozoa</span> resemble the Radiolaria in their fine radiating pseudopodia,
  but have an axial filament always present in each, and lack the central capsule; and are, for the
  most part, fresh-water forms. Finally, the <span class="sc">Proteomyxa</span> forms a sort of
  lumber-room for beings which are intermediate between the Heliozoa, Rhizopoda, and Flagellata,
  usually passing through an amoeboid stage, and for the most part reproducing by brood-formation.
  Zoospores that possess flagella are certainly known to occur in some forms of Foraminifera,
  Rhizopoda, Heliozoa, and Radiolaria, though not by any means in all of each group.<a id="NtA_63"

  <p>We have defined this group mainly by negative characters, as such are the only means for their
  differentiation from the remaining Sarcodina; and indeed from Flagellata, since in this group
  zoospores are sometimes formed which possess flagella. Moreover, indeed, in a few of this group
  (<i>Podostoma</i>, <i>Arcuothrix</i>), as in some Heliozoa, the flagellum or flagella may persist
  or be reproduced side by side with the pseudopodia. The subdivision of the Rhizopoda is again a
  matter of great difficulty, the characters presented being so mixed up that it is hard to choose:
  however, the character of the outer layer of the cytoplasm is perhaps the most obvious to select.
  In <span class="sc">Lobosa</span> there is a clear layer of ectosarc, which appears to be of a
  greasy nature at its surface film, so that it is not wetted. In the <span
  class="sc">Filosa</span>, as in most other Sarcodina, this film is absent, and the ectoplasm is
  not marked off from the endoplasm, and may have a granular surface. Corresponding to this, the
  pseudopodia of the Lobosa are usually blunt, never branching and fraying out, as it were, at the
  tip, as in the Filosa; nay, in the normal movements of <i>Amoeba limax</i> (Fig. 1, p. <a
  href="#page5">5</a>) the front of the cell forms one gigantic pseudopodium, which constantly
  glides forward. Apart from this distinction the two groups are parallel in almost every
  respect.</p>

  <p>There may be a single contractile vacuole, or a plurality; or none, especially in marine and
  endoparasitic species. The nucleus may remain single or multiply without inducing fission, thus
  leading to apocytial forms. It often gives off "chromidial" fragments, which may play an important
  part in reproduction.<a id="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> In <i>Amoeba binucleata</i>
  there are constantly two nuclei, both of which divide as an antecedent to fission, each giving a
  separate nucleus to either daughter-cell. <i>Pelomyxa palustris</i>, the giant of the group,
  attaining a diameter of 1&#x2034; (2 mm.), has very blunt pseudopodia, an enormous number of
  nuclei, and no contractile vacuole, though <span class="pagenum" id="page53"><span
  class="smaller">{53}</span></span>it is a fresh-water dweller, living in the bottom ooze of ponds,
  etc., richly charged with organic d&eacute;bris. It is remarkable also for containing symbiotic bacteria,
  and brilliant vesicles with a distinct membranous wall, containing a solution of glycogen.<a
  id="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> Few, if any, of the Filosa are recorded as
  plurinuclear.</p>

  <p>The simplest Lobosa have no investment, nor indeed any distinction of front or back. In some
  forms of <i>Amoeba</i>, however, the hinder part is more adhesive, and may assume the form of a
  sucker-like disc, or be drawn into a tuft of short filaments or villi, to which particles adhere.
  Other species of Lobosa and all Filosa have a "test," or "theca," <i>i.e.</i> an investment
  distinct from the outermost layer of the cell-body. The simplest cases are those of
  <i>Amphizonella</i>, <i>Dinamoeba</i>, and <i>Trichosphaerium</i>, where this is gelatinous, and
  in the two former allows the passage of food particles through it into the body by mere sinking
  in, like the protoplasm itself, closing again without a trace of perforation over the rupture. In
  <i>Trichosphaerium</i> (Fig. 9) the test is perforated by numerous pores of constant position for
  the passage of the pseudopodia, closing when these are retracted; and in the "A" form of the
  species (see below) it is studded with radial spicules of magnesium carbonate. Elsewhere the test
  is more consistent and possesses at least one aperture for the emission of pseudopodia and the
  reception of food; to avoid confusion we call this opening not the <i>mouth</i> but the "pylome":
  some Filosa have two symmetrically placed pylomes. When the test is a mere pellicle, it may be
  recognised by the limitation of the pseudopodia to the one pylomic area. But the shell is often
  hard. In <i>Arcella</i> (Fig. 10, C), a form common among Bog-mosses and Confervas, it is
  chitinous and shagreened, circular, with a shelf running in like that of a diving-bell around the
  pylome: there are two or more contractile vacuoles, and at least two nuclei. Like some other
  genera, it has the power of secreting carbonic acid gas in the form of minute bubbles in its
  cytoplasm, so as to enable it to float up to the surface of the water. The chitinous test shows
  minute hexagonal sculpturing, the expression of vertical partitions reaching from the inner to the
  outer layer.</p>

  <p>Several genera have tests of siliceous or chitinous plates, formed in the cytoplasm in the
  neighbourhood of the nucleus, and connected by chitinous cement. Among these <i>Quadrula</i> (Fig.
  10, A) is Lobose, with square plates, <i>Euglypha</i> (Fig. 8, p. <a href="#page29">29</a>), and
  <i>Paulinella</i><a id="NtA_69" href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> are Filose, with hexagonal
  plates. In the latter they are in five longitudinal rows, with a pentagonal oral plate, perforated
  by the oval pylome. In other genera again, such as <i>Cyphoderia</i> (Filosa), the plates are
  merely <span class="pagenum" id="page55"><span class="smaller">{55}</span></span>chitinous. Again,
  the shell may be encrusted with sand-grains derived directly from without, or from ingested
  particles, as shown in <i>Centropyxis</i>, <i>Difflugia</i> (Fig. 10, D), <i>Heleopera</i>, and
  <i>Campascus</i> when supplied with powdered glass instead of sand. The cement in <i>Difflugia</i>
  is a sort of organic mortar, infiltrated with ferric oxide (more probably ferric hydrate). In
  <i>Lecqueureusia spiralis</i> (formerly united with <i>Difflugia</i>) the test is formed of minute
  sausage-shaped granules, in which may be identified the partly dissolved valves of Diatoms taken
  as food; it is spirally twisted at the apex, as if it had enlarged after its first formation, a
  very rare occurrence in this group. The most frequent mode of fission in the testaceous Rhizopods
  (Figs. 8, 10) is what Schaudinn aptly terms "bud-fission," where half the protoplasm protrudes and
  accumulates at the mouth of the shell, and remains till a test has formed for it, while the other
  half retains the test of the original animal. The materials for the shell, whether sand-granules
  or plates, pass from the depths of the original shell outwards into the naked cell, and through
  its cytoplasm to the surface, where they become connected by cementing matter into a continuous
  test. The nucleus now divides into two, one of which passes into the external animal; after this
  the two daughter-cells separate, the one with the old shell, the other, larger, with the new
  one.</p>

  <p>If two individuals of the shelled species undergo bud-fission in close proximity, the offspring
  may partially coalesce, so that a monstrous shell is produced having two pylomes.</p>

  <p>Reproduction by fission has been clearly made out in most members of the group; some of the
  multinucleate species often abstrict a portion, sometimes at several points simultaneously, so
  that fission here passes into budding<a id="NtA_70" href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> (Fig. 9,
  <span class="smaller">2</span>, <span class="smaller">6</span>).</p>

  <p>Brood-division, either by resolution in the multinucleate species, or preceded by multiple
  nuclear division in the habitually 1-nucleate, though presumably a necessary incident in the
  life-history of every species, has only been seen, or at least thoroughly worked out, in a few
  cases, where it is usually preceded by encystment, and mostly by the extrusion into the cyst of
  any undigested matter.<a id="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In <i>Trichosphaerium</i> (Fig. 9) the cycle described by Schaudinn is very complex, and may be
  divided into two phases, which we may term the A and the B subcycles. The members of the A cycle
  are distinguished by the gelatinous investment being armed with radial spicules, which are absent
  from the B form. The close of the A cycle is marked by the large multinucleate body resolving
  itself into amoeboid zoospores (3), which escape from the gelatinous test, and develop into the
  large multinucleate adults of the B form. These, like the A form, may reproduce by fission or
  budding. At the term of growth, however, they retract their pseudopodia, expel the excreta, and
  multiply their nuclei by mitosis (7). Then the body is resolved into minute 2-flagellate
  microzoospores (8), which are <i>exogamous</i> gametes, <i>i.e.</i> they will only pair with
  similar zoospores from another cyst. The zygote (9-11) resulting from this conjugation is a minute
  amoeboid; its nucleus divides repeatedly, a gelatinous test is formed within which the spicules
  appear, and so the A form is reconstituted. In many of the test-bearing forms, whether Lobose or
  Filose, plastogamic unions occur, and the two nuclei may remain distinct, leading to plurinucleate
  monsters in their offspring by fission, or they may fuse and form a giant nucleus, a process which
  has here no relation to normal syngamy, as it is not associated with any marked change in the
  alternation of feeding and fission, etc. In <i>Trichosphaerium</i> also plastogamic unions between
  small individuals have for their only result the increase of size, enabling the produce to deal
  with <span class="pagenum" id="page57"><span class="smaller">{57}</span></span>larger prey.
  Temporary encystment in a "hypnocyst" is not infrequent in both naked and shelled species, and
  enables them to tide over drought and other unfavourable conditions.</p>

  <p>Schaudinn has discovered and worked out true syngamic processes, some bisexual, some exogamous,
  in several other Rhizopods. In <i>Chlamydophrys stercorea</i> the pairing-cells are equal, and are
  formed by the aggregation of the chromidia into minute nuclei around which the greater part of the
  cytoplasm aggregates, while the old nucleus (with a little cytoplasm) is lost. These brood-cells
  are 2-flagellate pairing-cells, which are exogamous: the zygote is a brown cyst; if this be
  swallowed by a mammal, the original <i>Chlamydophrys</i> appears in its faeces.<a id="NtA_72"
  href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Centropyxis aculeata</i>, a species very common in mud or moss, allied to <i>Difflugia</i>,
  also forms a brood by aggregation around nuclei derived from chromidia. The brood-cells are
  amoeboid, and secrete hemispherical shells like those of <i>Arcella</i>; some first divide into
  four smaller ones, before secreting the shell. Pairing takes place between the large and the small
  forms; and the zygote encysts. Weeks or months afterwards the cyst opens and its contents creep
  out as a minute <i>Centropyxis</i>. Finally, <i>Amoeba coli</i> produces its zygote in a way
  recalling that of <i>Actinosphaerium</i> (pp. <a href="#page73">73-75</a>, Fig. 21): the cell
  encysts; its nucleus divides, and each daughter divides again into two, which fuse reciprocally.
  Thus the cyst contains two zygote nuclei. After a time each of these divides twice, so that the
  mature cyst contains eight nuclei. Probably when swallowed by another animal they liberate a brood
  of eight young amoebae. Thus in different members of this group we have exogamy, both equal and
  bisexual, and endogamy.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Most of the Rhizopoda live among filamentous Algae in pools, ponds, and in shallow
  seas, etc.; some are "sapropelic" or mud-dwellers (many species of <i>Amoeba</i>, <i>Pelomyxa</i>,
  <i>Difflugia</i>, etc.), others frequent the roots of mosses. <i>Amoeba coli</i> is often found as
  a harmless denizen of the large intestine of man. <i>Amoeba histolytica</i>, lately distinguished
  therefrom by Schaudinn, is the cause of tropical dysentery. It multiplies enormously in the gut,
  and is found extending into the tissues, and making its way into the abscesses that so frequently
  supervene in the liver and other organs. <i>Chlamydophrys stercorea</i> is found in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page58"><span class="smaller">{58}</span></span>faeces of several mammals. The
  best monograph of this group is that of Penard.<a id="NtA_73"

  <p>The Allogromidiaceae are a well-marked and distinct order, on the whole resembling the
  Rhizopoda Filosa, and are often found with them in fresh water, while all other Foraminifera are
  marine. The type genus, <i>Allogromia</i> (Fig. 14, <span class="smaller">1</span>), has an oval
  chitinous shell. <i>Microgromia socialis</i> (Fig. 11) is often found in aggregates, the
  pseudopodia of neighbours fusing where they meet into a <span class="pagenum" id="page60"><span
  class="smaller">{60}</span></span>common network. This is due to the fact that one of the two
  daughter-cells at each fission, that does not retain the parent shell, remains in connexion with
  its sister that does: sometimes, however, it retracts its pseudopodia, except two which become
  flagella, wherewith it can swim off. The test of <i>Pamphagus</i> is a mere pellicle. In
  <i>Lieberk&uuml;hnia</i> (Fig. 12) it is hardly that; though the body does not give off the fine
  pseudopodia directly, but emits a thick process or "stylopodium"<a id="NtA_78"
  href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> comparable to the protoplasm protruded through the pylome of its
  better protected allies; and from this, which often stretches back parallel to the elongated body,
  the reticulum of pseudopodia is emitted. <i>Diaphorodon</i> has a shell recalling that of
  <i>Difflugia</i> (Fig. 10, D, p. <a href="#page55">55</a>), formed of sandy fragments, but with
  interstices between them through which as well as through the two pylomes the pseudopodia pass. In
  all of these the shell is formed as in the Rhizopods once for all, and does not grow afterwards;
  and the fresh-water forms, which are the majority, have one or more contractile vacuoles; in
  <i>Allogromia</i> they are very numerous, scattered on the expanded protoplasmic network.</p>

  <p>The remaining marine families may all be treated of generally, before noting their special
  characters.  Their marine habitat is variable, but in most cases restricted. A few extend up the
  brackish water of estuaries: a large number are found between tide-marks, or on the so-called
  littoral shelf extending to deep water; they are for the most part adherent to seaweeds, or lie
  among sand or on the mud. Other forms, again, are pelagic, such as <i>Globigerina</i> (Figs. 13,
  <span class="smaller">6</span>, 16, 17) and its allies, and float as part of the plankton, having
  the surface of their shells extended by delicate spines, their pseudopodia long and radiating, and
  the outer part of their cytoplasm richly vacuolated ("alveolate"), and probably containing a
  liquid lighter than sea water, as in the Radiolaria. Even these, after their death and the decay
  of the protoplasm, must sink to the bottom (losing the fine spines by solution as they fall); and
  they accumulate there, to form a light oozy mud, the "Globigerina-ooze" of geographers, at depths
  where the carbonic acid under pressure is not adequate to dissolve the more solid calcareous
  matter. Grey Chalk is such an ooze, consolidated by <span class="pagenum" id="page62"><span
  class="smaller">{62}</span></span>the lapse of time and the pressure of superincumbent layers.
  Some Foraminifera live on the sea bottom even at the greatest depths, and of course their shell is
  not composed of calcareous matter. Foraminifera may be obtained for examination by carefully
  washing sand or mud, collected on the beach at different levels between tide-marks, or from
  dredgings, or by carefully searching the surface of seaweeds, or by washing their roots, or,
  again, by the surface or deep-sea tow-net. The sand used to weight sponges for sale is the ready
  source of a large number of forms, and may be obtained for the asking from the sponge-dealers to
  whom it is a useless waste product. If this sand is dried in an oven, and then poured into water,
  the empty shells, filled with air, will float to the surface, and may be sorted by fine silk or
  wire gauze.</p>

  <p>From the resemblance of the shells of many of them to the Nautilus they were at first described
  as minute Cephalopods, or Cuttlefish, by d'Orbigny,<a id="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> and their true nature was only elucidated in the last century by
  the labours of Williamson, Carpenter, Dujardin, and Max Schultze. At first they possess only one
  nucleus, but in the adult stage may become plurinucleate without dividing, and this is especially
  the case in the "microsphaeric" states exhibited by many of those with a complex shell; the
  nucleus is apt to give off fragments (chromidia) which lie scattered in the cytoplasm. At first,
  too, in all cases, the shell has but a single chamber, a state that persists through life in some.
  When the number of chambers increases, their number has no relation to that of the nuclei, which
  remains much smaller till brood-formation sets in.</p>

  <p>The shell-substance, if calcareous, has one of the two types, porcellanous or vitreous, that we
  have already mentioned, but <i>Polytrema</i>, a form of very irregular shape, though freely
  perforated, is of a lovely pink colour. In the calcareous shells sandy particles may be
  intercalated, forming a transition to the Arenacea. In these the cement has an organic base
  associated with calcareous or ferruginous matter; in some, however, the cement is a phosphate of
  iron. The porcellanous shells are often deep brown by transmitted light.</p>

  <p>Despite the apparent uniformity of the protoplasmic body in this group, the shell is infinitely
  varied in form. As Carpenter writes, in reference to the Arenacea, "There is nothing more
  wonderful in nature than the building up of these elaborate and symmetrical structures by mere
  jelly-specks, presenting no traces <span class="pagenum" id="page64"><span
  class="smaller">{64}</span></span>whatever of that definite organisation which we are accustomed
  to regard as necessary to the manifestations of conscious life.... The tests (shells) they
  construct when highly magnified bear comparison with the most skilful masonry of man. From the
  same sandy bottom one species picks up the coarsest quartz grains, unites them together with a
  ferruginous cement, and thus constructs a flask-shaped test, having a short neck and a single
  large orifice; another picks up the finer grains and puts them together with the same cement into
  perfectly spherical tests of the most extraordinary finish, perforated with numerous small pores
  disposed at pretty regular intervals. Another species selects the minutest sand grains and the
  terminal portions of sponge-spicules, and works them up together&mdash;apparently with no cement
  at all, but by the mere laying of the spicules&mdash;into perfect white spheres like homoeopathic
  globules, each showing a single-fissured orifice. And another, which makes a straight,
  many-chambered test, the conical mouth of each chamber projecting into the cavity of the next,
  while forming the walls of its chambers of ordinary sand grains rather loosely held together,
  shapes the conical mouths of the chambers by firmly cementing together the quartz grains which
  border it." The structure of the shell is indeed variable. The pylome may be single or represented
  by a row of holes (<i>Peneroplis</i>, <i>Orbitolites</i>), or, again, there may be several pylomes
  (<i>Calcituba</i>); and, again, there are in addition numerous scattered pores for the protrusion
  of pseudopodia elsewhere than from the stylopodium, in the whole of the "Vitrea" and in many
  "Arenacea"; and, as we shall see, this may exercise a marked influence on the structure of the
  shell.</p>

  <p>In some cases the shell is simple, and in <i>Cornuspira</i> and <i>Spirillina</i> increases so
  as to have the form of a flat coiled tube. In <i>Calcituba</i> the shell branches irregularly in a
  dichotomous way, and the older parts break away as the seaweed on which they grow is eaten away,
  and fall to the bottom, while the younger branches go on growing and branching. The fallen pieces,
  if they light on living weed, attach themselves thereto and repeat the original growth; if not,
  the protoplasm crawls out and finds a fresh weed and forms a new tube. In the "Polythalamia" new
  chambers are formed by the excess of the protoplasm emerging and surrounding itself with a shell,
  organically united with the existing chamber or chambers, and in a space-relation which follows
  definite laws characteristic of the species or of its stage of growth, so as to give rise to
  circular, spiral, or irregular complexes (see Fig. 13).</p>

  <p>In most <span class="pagenum" id="page66"><span class="smaller">{66}</span></span>cases the
  part of the previously existing chamber next the pylome serves as the hinder part of the new
  chamber, and the old pylome becomes the pore of communication. But in some of the "Perforata" each
  new chamber forms a complete wall of its own ("proper wall," Fig. 13, <span
  class="smaller">8</span><i>b</i>), and the space between the two adjacent walls is filled with an
  intermediate layer traversed by canals communicating with the cavities of the chambers
  ("intermediate skeleton"), while an external layer of the same character may form a continuous
  covering. The shell of the Perforata may be adorned with pittings or fine spines, which serve to
  increase the surface of support in such floating forms as <i>Globigerina</i>, <i>Hastigerina</i>,
  and the like (Fig. 17). In the "Imperforata" the outer layer is often ornamented with regular
  patterns of pits, prominences, etc., which are probably formed by a thin reflected external layer
  of protoplasm. In some of the "Arenacea" a "labyrinthine" complex of laminae is formed.</p>

  <p>A very remarkable point which has led to great confusion in the study of the Foraminifera, is
  the fact that the shell on which we base our characters of classification, may vary very much,
  even within the same individual. Thus in the genus <i>Orbitolites</i> the first few chambers of
  the shell have the character of a Milioline, in <i>Orbiculina</i> of a <i>Peneroplis</i>. The
  arrangements of the Milioline shell, known as Triloculine, Quinqueloculine, and Biloculine
  respectively, may succeed one another in the same shell (Figs. 14 <span class="smaller">4</span>,
  15). A shell may begin as a spiral and end by a straight continuation: again, the spherical
  <i>Orbulina</i> (Fig. 16 <span class="smaller">1</span>) is formed as an investment to a shell
  indistinguishable from <i>Globigerina</i>, which is ultimately absorbed. In some cases, as
  Rhumbler has pointed out, the more recent and higher development shows itself in the first formed
  chambers, while the later, younger chambers remain at a lowlier stage, as in the case of the
  spiral passing into a straight succession; but the other cases we have cited show that this is not
  always the case. In <i>Lagena</i> (Fig. 13 <span class="smaller">2</span>) the pylome is produced
  into a short tube, which may protrude from the shell or be turned into it, so that for the latter
  form the genus <i>Entosolenia</i> was founded. Shells identical in minute sculpture are, however,
  found with either form of neck, and, moreover, the polythalamial shells (<i>Nodosaria</i>, Fig. 13
  <span class="smaller">3</span>), formed of a nearly straight succession of <i>Lagena</i>-like
  chambers, may have these chambers with their <span class="pagenum" id="page67"><span
  class="smaller">{67}</span></span>communications on either type. Rhumbler goes so far as to
  suggest that all so-called <i>Lagena</i> shells are either the first formed chamber of a
  <i>Nodosaria</i> which has not yet become polythalamian by the formation of younger ones, or are
  produced by the separation of an adult <i>Nodosaria</i> into separate chambers.</p>

  <p>Many of the chambered species show a remarkable dimorphism, first noted by Schlumberger, and
  finally elucidated by J. J. Lister and Schaudinn. It reveals itself in the size of the initial
  chamber; accordingly, the two forms may be distinguished as "microspheric" and "megalospheric"
  respectively (Fig. 15), the latter being much the commoner. The microspheric form has always a
  plurality of nuclei, the megalospheric a single one, except at the approach of reproduction.
  Chromidial masses are, however, present in both forms. The life-history has been fully worked out
  in <i>Polystomella</i> by Schaudinn, and in great part in <i>Polystomella</i>, <i>Orbitolites</i>,
  etc., by Lister; and the same scheme appears to be general in the class, at least where the
  dimorphism noted occurs. The microspheric form gives birth only to the megalospheric, but the
  latter may reproduce megalospheric broods, or give rise to swarmers, which by their (exogamous)
  <span class="pagenum" id="page68"><span class="smaller">{68}</span></span>conjugation produce the
  microspheric young. The microspheric forms early become multinucleate, and have also numerous
  chromidia detached from the nuclei, which they ultimately replace. These collect in the outer part
  of the shell and aggregate into new nuclei, around which the cytoplasm concentrates, to separate
  into as many amoeboid young "pseudopodiospores" as there are nuclei. These escape from the shell
  or are liberated by its disintegration, and invest themselves with a shell to form the initial
  large central chamber or megalosphere.</p>

  <p>In the ordinary life of the megalospheric form the greater part of the chromatic matter is
  aggregated into a nucleus, some still remaining diffused. At the end of growth the nucleus itself
  disintegrates, and the chromidia concentrate into a number of small vesicular nuclei, each of
  which appropriates to itself a small surrounding zone of thick plasm and then divides by mitosis
  twice; and the 4-nucleate cells so formed are resolved into as many 1-nucleate, 2-flagellate
  swarmers, which conjugate <span class="pagenum" id="page69"><span

  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> The fusion of their nuclei takes place after some delay:
  ultimately the zygote nucleus divides into two, a shell is formed, and we have the microsphere,
  which is thus pluri-nucleate <i>ab initio</i>. As we have seen, the nuclei of the microsphere are
  ultimately replaced by chromidia, and the whole plasmic body divides into pseudopodiospores, which
  grow into the megalospheric form.</p>

  <p>In the Perforate genera, <i>Patellina</i> and <i>Discorbina</i>, plastogamy precedes brood
  formation, the cytoplasms of the 2-5 pairing individuals contracting a close union; and then the
  nuclei proceed to break up <i>without fusion</i>, while the cytoplasm aggregates around the young
  nuclei to form amoebulae, which acquire a shell and separate. In both cases it is the forms with a
  single nucleus, corresponding to <i>megalospheric</i> forms that so pair, and the brood-formation
  is, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, the same as in these forms. Similar individuals may reproduce in the
  same way, in both genera, without this plastogamic pairing, which is therefore, though probably
  advantageous, not essential. If pseudopodiospores form their shells while near one another, they
  may coalesce to form monsters, as often happens in <i>Orbitolites</i>.<a id="NtA_81"

  <p>The direct economic uses of the Foraminifera are perhaps greater than those of any other group
  of Protozoa. The Chalk is <span class="pagenum" id="page70"><span
  class="smaller">{70}</span></span>composed largely of <i>Textularia</i> and allied forms, mixed
  with the skeletons of Coccolithophoridae (pp. <a href="#page113">113-114</a>), known as
  Coccoliths, etc. The Calcaire Grossier of Paris, used as a building stone, is mainly composed of
  the shells of Miliolines of Eocene age; the Nummulites of the same age of the Mediterranean basin
  are the chief constituent of the stone of which the Pyramids of Egypt are built. Our own Oolitic
  limestones are composed of concretions around a central nucleus, which is often found to be a
  minute Foraminiferous shell.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The palaeontology of the individual genera is treated of in Chapman's and Lister's
  recent works. They range from the Lower Cambrian characterised by perforated hyaline genera, such
  as <i>Lagena</i>, to the present day. Gigantic arenaceous forms, such as <i>Loftusia</i>, are
  among the Tertiary representatives; but the limestones formed <i>principally</i> of their shells
  commence at the Carboniferous. The so-called Greensands contain greenish granules of "glauconite,"
  containing a ferrous silicate, deposited as a cast in the chambers of Foraminifera, and often left
  exposed by the solution of the calcareous shell itself. Such granules occur in deep-sea deposits
  of the present day.<a id="NtA_82" href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This class were at first regarded and described as fresh-water Radiolaria, but the differences
  were too great to escape the greatest living specialist in this latter group, Ernst Haeckel, who
  in 1866 created the Heliozoa for their reception. We owe our knowledge of it mainly to the labours
  of Cienkowsky, the late William Archer, F. E. Schulze, R. Hertwig, Lesser, and latterly to
  Schaudinn, who has monographed it for the "Tierreich" (1896); and Penard has published a more

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Actinophrys sol</i> Ehrb. (Fig. 18) is a good and common type. It owes its name to its
  resemblance to a conventional drawing of the sun, with a spherical body and numerous close-set
  diverging rays. The cytoplasm shows a more coarsely vacuolated outer layer, sometimes called the
  ectosarc, and a denser internal layer the endosarc. In the centre of the figure is the large
  nucleus, to which the continuations of the rays may be seen to converge; the pseudopodia contain
  each a stiffish axial filament,<a id="NtA_83" href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> which is covered
  by the fine granular plasm, showing currents of the granules. The axial filament disappears when
  the pseudopodia are retracted or bent, and is regenerated afterwards. This bending occurs when a
  living prey touches and adheres to a ray, all its neighbours bending in like the tentacles of a
  Sundew. The prey is carried down to the surface of the ectoplasm, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page72"><span class="smaller">{72}</span></span>sinks into it with a little water, to form a
  nutritive vacuole. Fission is the commonest mode of reproduction, and temporary plastogamic unions
  are not uncommon. Arising from these true conjugations occur, two and two, as described by
  Schaudinn. A gelatinous cyst wall forms about the two which are scarcely more than in contact with
  their rays withdrawn. Then in each the nucleus divides into two, one of which passes to the
  surface, and is lost (as a "polar body"), while the other approaches the corresponding nucleus of
  the mate, and unites with it, while at the same time the cytoplasms fuse. Within the gelatinous
  cyst the zygote so formed divides to produce two sister resting spores, from each of which, after
  a few days, a young <i>Actinophrys</i> escapes, as may take place indeed after encystment of an
  ordinary form without conjugation.</p>

      (<i>chr</i>). (From Parker and Haswell.)</p>
    </div>

  <p>The axial rods of the pseudopodia may pass either to the circumference of the nucleus or to a
  central granule, corresponding, it would appear, to a centrosome or blepharoplast; or again, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page73"><span class="smaller">{73}</span></span>in the plurinucleate marine
  genus <i>Camptonema</i>, each rod abuts on a separate cap on the outer side of each nucleus. The
  nucleus is single in all but the genera <i>Actinosphaerium</i>, <i>Myxastrum</i>,
  <i>Camptonema</i>, and <i>Gymnosphaera</i>. The movements of this group are very slow, and are not
  well understood. A slow rolling over on the points of the rays has been noted, and in
  <i>Camptonema</i> they move very decidedly to effect locomotion, the whole body also moving
  Amoeba-fashion; but of the distinct movements of the species when floating no explanation can be
  given. The richly vacuolate ectoplasm undoubtedly helps to sustain the cell, and the extended rays
  must subserve the same purpose by so widely extending the surface. <i>Dimorpha</i> (Fig. 37, <span
  class="smaller">5</span>, p. <a href="#page112">112</a>) has the power of swimming by protruding a
  pair of long flagella from the neighbourhood of the eccentric nucleus; and <i>Myriophrys</i> has
  an investment of long flagelliform cilia. <i>Actinomonas</i> has a stalk and a single flagellum in
  addition to the pseudopodia; these genera form a transition to the Flagellata.</p>

  <p>Several species habitually contain green bodies, which multiply by bipartition, and are
  probably Zoochlorellae, Chlamydomonadidae of the same nature as we shall find in certain Ciliata
  (pp. <a href="#page154">154</a>, <a href="#page158">158</a>) in fresh-water Sponges (see p. <a
  href="#page175">175</a>), in <i>Hydra viridis</i> (p. <a href="#page256">256</a>), and the marine
  Turbellarian <i>Convoluta</i> (Vol. II. p. 43).</p>

  <p>Reproduction by fission is not rare, and in some cases (<i>Acanthocystis</i>) the cell becomes
  multinuclear, and buds off 1-nucleate cells. In such cases the buds at first lack a centrosome,
  and a new one is formed first in the nucleus, and passes out into the cytoplasm. These buds become
  2-flagellate before settling down. In <i>Clathrulina</i> the formation of 2-flagellate zoospores
  has long been known (Fig. 20, <span class="smaller">3</span>). In <i>Actinosphaerium</i> (Figs.
  19, 21), a large species, differing from <i>Actinophrys</i> only in the presence of numerous
  nuclei in its endoplasm, a peculiar process, which we have characterised as <i>endogamy</i>,
  results in the formation of resting spores. The animal retracts its rays and encysts; and the
  number of nuclei is much reduced by their mutual fusion, or by the solution of many of them, or by
  a combination of the two processes. The body then breaks up into cells with a single nucleus, and
  each of these surrounds itself with a wall to form a cyst of the second order.</p>

  <p>Each of these divides, and the two sister cells then conjugate after the same fashion as in
  <i>Actinophrys</i>, but the nuclear divisions to form the coupling nucleus are two in number,
  <i>i.e.</i> the nucleus divides into two, one of which goes to the surface as the first polar
  body, and the sister of this again divides to form a second polar body (which also passes to <span

  <p>We exclude Haeckel's Dictyochida, with a skeleton recalling that of the Stephoidea, but of the
  impure hollow substance of the Phaeodaria (p. <a href="#page84">84</a>). They rank now as
  Silicoflagellates (p. <a href="#page114">114</a>).</p>

  <p>The Radiolarian is distinguished from all other Protozoa by the chitinous central capsule, so
  that its cytoplasm is separated into an outer layer, the <i>extracapsular</i> protoplasm
  (ectoplasm), and a central mass, the <i>intracapsular</i>, containing the nucleus.<a id="NtA_88"
  href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <i>extracapsular</i> layer forms in its substance a gelatinous mass, of variable reaction,
  through which the plasma itself ramifies as a network of threads ("sarcodictyum"), uniting at the
  surface to constitute the foundation for the pseudopodia. This gelatinous matter constitutes the
  "calymma." It is largely vacuolated, the vacuoles ("alveoli"), of exceptional size, lying in the
  nodes of the plasmic network, and containing a liquid probably of lower specific gravity than
  seawater; and they are especially abundant towards the surface, where they touch and become
  polygonal. On mechanical irritation they disappear, to be formed anew after an interval, a fact
  that may explain the sinking from the surface in disturbed water. This layer may contain minute
  pigment granules, but the droplets of oil and of albuminous matter frequent in the central layer
  are rare here. <span class="pagenum" id="page80"><span class="smaller">{80}</span></span>The
  "yellow cells" of a symbiotic Flagellate or Alga, <i>Zooxanthella</i>, are embedded in the jelly
  of all except Phaeodaria, and the whole ectosarc has the average consistency of a firm jelly.</p>

  <p>The <i>pseudopodia</i> are long and radiating, with a granular external layer, whose streaming
  movements are continuous with those of the inner network. In the Acantharia they contain a firm
  axial filament, like that of the Heliozoa, which is traceable to the central capsule; and
  occasionally a bundle of pseudopodia may coalesce to form a stout process like a flagellum
  ("sarcoflagellum"). Here, too, each spine, at its exit from the jelly, is surrounded by a little
  cone of contractile filaments, the <i>myophrisks</i>, whose action seems to be to pull up the
  jelly and increase the volume of the spherical body so as to diminish its density.</p>

  <p>The <i>intracapsular protoplasm</i> is free from <i>Zooxanthella</i> except in the Acantharia.
  It is less abundantly vacuolated, and is finely granular. In the Porulosa it shows a radial
  arrangement, with pyramidal stretches of hyaline plasma separated by intervals rich in granules.
  Besides the alveoli with watery contents, others are present with albuminoid matter in solution.
  Oil-drops, often brilliantly coloured, occur either in the plasma or floating in either kind of
  vacuole; and they are often luminous at night. Added to these, the intracapsular plasm contains
  pigment-granules, most frequently red or orange, <span class="pagenum" id="page81"><span
  class="smaller">{81}</span></span>passing into yellow or brown, though violet, blue, and green
  also occur. The "phaeodium,"<a id="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> however, that gives
  its name to the Phaeodaria, is an aggregate of dark grey, green, or brown granules which are
  probably formed in the endoplasm, but accumulate in the extracapsular plasm of the oral side of
  the central capsule. Inorganic concretions and crystals are also found in the contents of the
  central capsule, as well as aggregates of unknown composition, resembling starch-grains in
  structure.</p>

  <p>In the Monopylaea, or Nassellaria (Figs. 25, B, 26, A), the endoplasm is differentiated above
  the perforated area of the central capsule into a cone of radiating filaments termed the
  "porocone," which may be channels for the communication between the exoplasm and the endoplasm, or
  perhaps serve, as Haeckel suggests, to raise, by their contraction, the perforated area: he
  compares them to the myophane striae of Infusoria. In the Phaeodaria (Fig. 26, B), a radiating
  laminated cone is seen in the outermost layer of the endoplasm above the principal opening
  ("astropyle"), and a fibrillar one around the two accessory ones ("parapyles"); and in some cases,
  continuous with these, the whole outer layer of the endoplasm shows a meridional striation.</p>

  <p>The <i>nucleus</i> is contained in the endoplasm, and is always at first single, though it may
  divide again and again. The nuclear wall is a firm membrane, sometimes finely porous. If there are
  concentric shells it at first occupies the innermost, which it may actually come to enclose,
  protruding lobes which grow through the several perforations of the lattice-work, finally
  coalescing outside completely, so as to show no signs of the joins. In the Nassellaria a similar
  process usually results in the formation of a lobed nucleus, contained in an equally lobed central
  capsule. The chromatin of the nucleus may be concentrated into a central mass, or distributed into
  several "nucleoli," or it may assume the form of a twisted, gut-like filament, or, again, the
  nuclear plasm may be reticulated, with the chromatin deposited at the nodes of the network.</p>

  <p>The skeleton of this group varies, as shown in our conspectus, in the several divisions.<a
  id="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> The Acantharia (Figs. 24, 25, A) have a skeleton of
  radiating spines meeting in the centre of figure of the endoplasm, and forcing the nucleus to one
  side. The spines are typically 20 in number, and emerge from the surface of the regular spherical
  forms (from which the others may be readily derived) radially, in five sets of four in the regions
  corresponding to the equator and the tropics and polar circles of our world. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page83"><span class="smaller">{83}</span></span>The four rays of adjacent circles alternate,
  so that the "polar" and "equatorial" rays are on one set of meridians 90&deg; apart, and the
  "tropical" spines are on the intermediate meridians, as shown in the figures. By tangential
  branching, and the meeting or coalescence of the branches, reticulate (Figs. 23, 24, 25) and
  latticed shells are formed in some families, with circles of openings or pylomes round the bases
  of the spines. In the Sphaerocapsidae the spines are absent, but their original sites are inferred
  from the 20 circles of pylomes.</p>

  <p>In the Spumellaria the simplest form of the (siliceous) skeleton is that of detached spicules,
  simple or complex, or passing into a latticed shell, often with one or more larger openings
  (pylomes). Radiating spines often traverse the whole of the cavity, becoming continuous with its
  latticed wall, and bind firmly the successive zones when present (Fig. 23).</p>

  <p><i>Calcaromma calcarea</i> was described by Wyville Thomson as having a shell of apposed
  calcareous discs, and <i>Myxobrachia</i>, by Haeckel, as having collections of the calcareous
  Coccoliths and Coccospheres. In both cases we have to do with a Radiolarian not possessing a
  skeleton, but retaining the undigested shells of its food, in the former case (<i>Actissa</i>) in
  a continuous layer, in the latter (<i>Thalassicolla</i>) in accumulations that, by their weight,
  droop and pull out the lower hemisphere into distinct arms.</p>

  <p>The (siliceous) skeleton of the Nassellaria is absent only in the Nassoidea, and is never
  represented by distinct spicules. Its simplest form is a "tripod" with the legs downward, and the
  central capsule resting on its apex. The addition of a fourth limb converts the tripod into a
  "calthrop," the central capsule in this case resting between the upturned leg and two of the lower
  three regarded as the "anterolateral"; the odd lower leg, like the upturned one, being
  "posterior." Again, the skeleton may present a "sagittal ring," often branched and spiny (Fig. 26,
  A), or combined with the tripod or calthrop, or complicated by the addition of one or more
  horizontal rings. Another type is presented by the "latticed chamber" surrounding the central
  capsule, with a wide mouth ("pylome") below. This is termed the "cephalis"; it may be combined in
  various ways with the sagittal ring and the tripod or calthrop; and, again, it may be prolonged by
  the addition of one, two, or three chambers below, <span class="pagenum" id="page84"><span
  class="smaller">{84}</span></span>the last one opening by a pylome (Fig. 25, B). These are termed
  "thorax," "abdomen," and "post-abdomen" respectively.</p>

  <p>In the Phaeodaria the skeleton may be absent, spicular (of loose or connected spicules) or
  latticed, continuous or bivalve. It is composed of silica combined with organic matter, so that it
  chars when heated, is more readily dissolved, and is not preserved in fossilisation. The spicules
  or lattice-work are hollow, often with a central filament running in the centre of the gelatinous
  contents. The latticed structure of the shell of the Challengeridae (Fig. 28) is so fine as to
  recall that of the Diatomaceae. In the Phaeoconchida the shell is in two halves, parted along the
  "frontal" plane of the three apertures of the capsule.</p>

      Radiolaria. (From Verworn, after Dreyer.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The central capsule (rarely inconspicuous and difficult, if not impossible to demonstrate) is
  of a substance which resembles chitin, though its chemical reactions have not been fully studied
  hitherto, and indeed vary from species to species. It is composed of a single layer, except in
  <i>Phaeodaria</i>, where it is double. The operculum in this group, <i>i.e.</i> the area around
  the aperture, is composed of an outer layer, which is radially thickened, and a thin inner layer;
  the former is produced into the projecting tube ("proboscis").</p>

  <p><b>Reproduction</b> in the Radiolaria may be simple fission due to the binary fission of the
  nucleus, the capsule, and the ectoplasm in succession. If this last feature is omitted we have a
  colonial organism, composed of the common ectoplasm containing numerous central capsules; and the
  genera in which this occurs, all belonging to the Peripylaea, were formerly separated (as
  Polycyttaria) from <span class="pagenum" id="page85"><span class="smaller">{85}</span></span>the
  remaining Radiolaria (Monocyttaria). They may either lack a skeleton (Collozoidae, Fig. 22), or
  have a skeleton of detached spicules (Sphaerozoidae), or possess latticed shells (Collosphaeridae)
  one for each capsule, and would seem therefore to belong, as only differentiated by their colonial
  habit, to the several groups having these respective characters. Fission has been well studied in
  <i>Aulacantha</i> (a Phaeodarian) by Borgert.<a id="NtA_91" href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> He
  finds that in this case the skeleton is divided between the daughter-cells, and the missing part
  is regenerated. In cases where this is impossible one of the daughter-cells retains the old
  skeleton, and the other escapes as a bud to form a new skeleton.</p>

  <p>Two modes of reproduction by flagellate zoospores have been described (Fig. 22). In the one
  mode all the zoospores are alike&mdash;isospores&mdash;and frequently contain a crystal of proteid
  nature as well as oil-globules. In the Polycyttaria alone has the second mode of spore-formation
  been seen, and that in the same species in which the formation of isospores occurs. Here
  "anisospores" are formed, namely, large "mega-," and small "micro-zoospores." They probably
  conjugate as male and female respectively; but neither has the process been observed, nor has any
  product of such conjugation (zygote) been recognised. In every case the formation of the zoospores
  only involves the <span class="pagenum" id="page86"><span
  class="smaller">{86}</span></span>endoplasm: the nucleus first undergoes brood division, and the
  plasma within the capsule becomes concentrated about its offspring, and segregates into the
  spores; the extracapsular plasm disintegrates.<a id="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <b>Yellow Cells</b> (<i>Zooxanthella</i>), so frequently found in the Radiolaria were long
  thought to be constituents of their body. Cienkowsky found that when the host died from being kept
  in unchanged water, the yellow cells survived and multiplied freely, often escaping from the
  gelatinised cell-wall as biflagellate zoospores. The cell-wall is of cellulose. The cell contains
  two chloroplastids, or plates coloured with the vegetal pigment "diatomin." Besides ordinary
  transverse fission in the ordinary encysted state in the ectoplasm of the host, when free they may
  pass into what is known as a "<i>Palmella</i>-state," the cell-walls gelatinising; in this
  condition they multiply freely, and constitute a jelly in which the individual cells are seen as
  rounded bodies. They contain starch in two forms&mdash;large hollow granules, not doubly
  refractive, and small solid granules which polarise light. We may regard them as Chrysomonadaceae
  (p. <a href="#page113">113</a>). Similar organisms occur in many Anthozoa (see pp. <a
  href="#page261">261</a>, <a href="#page339">339</a>, <a href="#page373">373</a> f., <a
  href="#page396">396</a>). Diatomaceae (yellow Algae with silicified cell-walls) sometimes live in
  the jelly of certain <i>Collosphaera</i>. Both these forms live in the state known as "symbiosis"
  with their host; <i>i.e.</i> they are in mutually helpful association, the Radiolarian absorbing
  salts from the water for the nutrition of both, and the Alga or Flagellate taking up the
  CO<sub>2</sub> due to the respiration of the host, and building up organic material, the surplus
  of which is doubtless utilised, at least in part, for the nutrition of the host. A similar union
  between a Fungus and a coloured vegetal ("holophytic") organism is known as a Lichen.</p>

  <p>The Suctorian Infusorian <i>Amoebophrya</i> is parasitic in the ectoplasm of certain
  Acantharia, and in the peculiar genus <i>Sticholonche</i> which appears to be intermediate between
  this group and Heliozoa.</p>

  <p>The Silicoflagellate family Dictyochidae are found temporarily <span class="pagenum"
  id="page87"><span class="smaller">{87}</span></span>embedded in the ectoplasm of some of the
  Phaeocystina, and have a skeleton of similar nature. Their true nature was shown by Borgert.</p>

  <p>The Amphipod crustacean <i>Hyperia</i><a id="NtA_93" href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a> may
  enter the jelly of the colonial forms, and feed there at will on the host.<a id="NtA_94"
  href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Haeckel, in his Monograph of the Radiolaria of the <i>Challenger</i> enumerated 739 genera,
  comprising 4318 species; and Dreyer has added 6 new genera, comprising 39 species, besides 7
  belonging to known genera. Possibly, as we shall see, many of the species may be mere states of
  growth, for it is impossible to study the life-histories of this group; on the other hand, it is
  pretty certain that new forms are likely to be discovered and described. The Radiolaria are found
  living at all depths in the sea, by the superficial or deep tow-net; and some appear to live near
  the bottom, where the durable forms of the whole range also settle and accumulate. They thus form
  what is known as Radiolarian ooze, which is distinguished from other shallower deposits chiefly
  through the disappearance by solution of all calcareous skeletons, as they slowly fell through the
  waters whereon they originally floated at the same time with the siliceous remains of the
  Radiolaria. The greatest wealth of forms is found in tropical seas, though in some places in cold
  regions large numbers of individuals of a limited range of species have been found.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Radiolaria of the groups with a pure siliceous skeleton can alone be fossilised,
  even the impure siliceous skeleton of the Phaeodaria readily dissolving in the depths at which
  they live: they have been generally described by Ehrenberg's name <i>Polycystineae</i>. Tripolis
  (<i>Kieselguhr</i>) of Tertiary ages have been found in many parts of the globe, consisting
  largely or mainly of Radiolaria, and representing a Radiolarian ooze. That of the Miocene of
  Barbados contains at least 400 species; that of Gruppe at least 130. In Secondary and Palaeozoic
  rocks such oozes pass into Radiolarian quartzites (some as recent as the Jurassic). They occur
  also in fossilised excrement (coprolites), and in flint or chert concretions, as far down as the
  lowest fossiliferous rocks, <span class="pagenum" id="page88"><span
  class="smaller">{88}</span></span>the Cambrian. The older forms are simple Sphaerellaria and
  Nassellaria. From a synopsis of the history of the order in Haeckel's <i>Monograph</i> (pp.
  clxxxvi.-clxxxviii.) we learn that while a large number of skeletal forms had been described by
  Ehrenberg, Huxley in 1851 published the first account of the living animal. Since then our
  knowledge has been extended by the labours of Haeckel, Cienkowsky, R. Hertwig, Karl Brandt, and A.
  Borgert.</p>

  <p><i>Sarcodina without a clear ectoplasm, whose active forms are amoeboid or flagellate, or pass
  from the latter form to the former; multiplying chiefly, if not exclusively, by brood-formation in
  a cyst. No complete cell-pairing (syngamy) known, though the cytoplasms may unite into plasmodia;
  pseudopodia of the amoeboid forms usually radiate or filose, but without axial filaments.
  Saprophytic or parasitic in living animals or plants.</i></p>

  <p>This group is a sort of lumber-room for forms which it is hard to place under Rhizopoda or
  Flagellata, and which produce simple cysts for reproduction, not fructifications like the
  Mycetozoa. The cyst may be formed for protection under drought ("hypnocyst"), or as a preliminary
  to spore-formation ("sporocyst"). The latter may have a simple wall (simple sporocyst), or else
  two or three formed in succession ("resting cyst"), so as to enable it to resist prolonged
  desiccation, etc.: both differing from the hypnocyst in that their contents undergo brood
  formation. On encystment any indigestible food materials are extruded into the cyst, and in the
  "resting cysts," which are usually of at least two layers, this faecal mass lies in the space
  between them. The brood-cells escape, either as flagellate-cells, resembling the simpler
  Protomastigina, called "flagellulae," and which often become amoeboid (Fig. 29); or already
  furnished with pseudopodia, and called "amoebulae," though they usually recall <i>Actinophrys</i>
  rather than <i>Amoeba</i>. In <i>Vampyrella</i> and some others the amoebulae fuse, and so attain
  a greater size, which is most probably advantageous for feeding purposes. But usually it is as a

  <p>I. The <b>Acrasieae</b> are a small group of saprophytes, often in the most literal sense,
  though in some cases it has been proved that the actual food is the bacteria of putrefaction. In
  them, since no cell-division takes place in the fructification, it is certain that the
  multiplication of the species must be due to the fissions of the amoeboid zoospores, which often
  have the habit of <i>Amoeba limax</i> (Fig. 1, p. <a href="#page5">5</a>).</p>

  <p>II. <b>Filoplasmodieae.</b>&mdash;<i>Chlamydomyxa</i><a id="NtA_97"
  href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> is a not uncommon inhabitant of the cells of bog-mosses and
  bog-pools, and its nutrition may be holophytic, as it contains chromoplasts; but it <span
  class="pagenum" id="page91"><span class="smaller">{91}</span></span>can also feed amoeba-fashion.
  <i>Labyrinthula</i> is marine, and in its fructification each of the component cells forms four
  spores. <i>Leydenia</i> has been found in the fluid of ascitic dropsy, associated with malignant
  tumour.</p>

  <p>III. <b>Myxomycetes.</b>&mdash;The fructification in this group is not formed by the mere
  aggregation of the zoospores, but these fuse by their cytoplasm to form a multinucleate body, the
  "plasmodium," which, after moving and growing (with nuclear division) for some time like a great
  multinucleate Reticularian, passes into rest, and develops a fructification by the formation of a
  complex outer wall; within this the contents, after multiplication of the nuclei, resolve
  themselves into uninucleate spores, each with its own cyst-wall. The fructifications of this group
  are often conspicuous, and resemble those of the Gasteromycetous fungi (<i>e.g.</i>, the
  Puffballs), whence they were at first called <i>Myxogastres</i>. De Bary first discovered their
  true nature in 1859, and ever since they have been claimed by botanist and zoologist alike.</p>

  <p>The spore on germination liberates its contents as a minute flagellate, with a single anterior
  lash and a contractile vacuole (Fig. 30, C). It soon loses the lash, becomes amoeboid, and feeds
  on bacteria, etc. (Fig. 30, D, E). In this state it can pass into hypnocysts, from which, as from
  the spores, it emerges as a flagellula. After a time the amoeboids, which may multiply by fission,
  fuse on meeting, so as to form the plasmodium (Fig. 30, F). This contains numerous nuclei, which
  multiply as it grows, and numerous contractile vacuoles. When it attains full size it becomes
  negatively hydrotactic, crawls to a dry place, and resolves itself into the fructification. The
  external wall, and sometimes a basal support to the fruit, are differentiated from the outer layer
  of protoplasm; while the nuclei within, after undergoing a final bipartition, concentrate each
  around an independent portion of plasma, which again is surrounded as a spore by a cyst-wall.
  Often the maturing plasmodium within the wall of the fruit is traversed by a network of
  anastomosing tubes filled with liquid, the walls of which become differentiated into membrane like
  the fruit-wall, and are continuous therewith. As the fruit ripens the liquid dries, and the tubes
  now form a network of hollow threads, the "capillitium," often with external spiral ridges (Fig.
  30, A, B). These are very hygroscopic, and by their expansion and contraction <span
  class="pagenum" id="page92"><span class="smaller">{92}</span></span>determine the rupture of the
  fruit-wall and the scattering of the spores.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Again, in some cases the plasmodia themselves aggregate in the same way as the
  amoeboids do in the <i>Acrasieae</i>, and combine to form a compound fruit termed an

  <p>As a type we will take a simple form of the highest group, the Gregarinidaceae,
  <i>Monocystis</i>, which inhabits the seminal vesicles of the earthworm. In its youngest state,
  the "sporozoite," it is a naked, sickle-shaped cell, which probably makes its way from the gut
  into one of the large radial cells of the seminal funnel, where it attains its full size, and then
  passes out into the vesicles or reservoirs of the semen, to lie among the sperm morulae and young
  spermatozoa. The whole interior is formed of the opaque endosarc, which contains a large central
  nucleus, and is full of refractive granules of paramylum or paraglycogen,<a id="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> a carbohydrate allied to glycogen or animal starch, so common
  in the liver and <span class="pagenum" id="page96"><span class="smaller">{96}</span></span>muscles
  of Metazoa; besides these it contains proteid granules which stain with carmine, and oil-drops.
  The ectosarc is formed of three layers: (1) the outer layer or "cuticle"<a id="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> is, in many cases if not here, ribbed, with minute pores in
  the furrows, and is always porous enough to allow the diffusion of dissolved nutriment; (2) a
  clear plasmatic layer, the "sarcocyte"; (3) the "myocyte," formed of "myonemes," muscular fibrils
  disposed in a network with transverse meshes, which effect the wriggling movements of the cell.
  The endosarc contains the granules and the large central nucleus. The adult becomes free in the
  seminal vesicles; here two approximate, and surround themselves with a common cyst: a process
  which has received the name of "association" (Fig. 31, <i>g-i</i>). Within this, however, the
  protoplasms remain absolutely distinct. The nucleus undergoes peculiar changes by which its volume
  is considerably reduced. When this process of "nuclear reduction" is completed, each of the mates
  undergoes brood-divisions (<i>j</i>), so as to give rise to a large number of rounded naked
  1-nucleate cells&mdash;the true pairing-cells. These unite two and two, and so form the 1-nucleate
  spores (<i>k-m</i>), which become oat-shaped, form a dense cyst-wall, and have been termed
  "pseudonavicellae" from their likeness to the Diatomaceous genus <i>Navicella</i>. Some of the
  cytoplasm of the original cells remains over unused, as "epiplasm," and ultimately degenerates, as
  do a certain number of the brood-cells which presumably have failed to pair. It is believed that
  the brood-cells from the same parent will not unite together. The contents of each spore have
  again undergone brood-division to form eight sickle-shaped zoospores, or "sporozoites"
  (<i>n-q</i>), and thus the developmental cycle is completed. Probably the spores, swallowed by
  birds, pass out in their excrement, and when eaten by an earthworm open in its gut; the freed
  sickle-germs can now migrate through the tissues to the seminal funnels, in the cells of which
  they grow, ultimately becoming free in the seminal vesicles.<a id="NtA_103"

  <p><i>Monocystis</i> offers us the simplest type of <b>Gregarinidaceae</b>. In most Gregarines
  (Figs. 31, 32) the sporozoite enters the epithelium-cell of the gut of an Arthropod, Worm or
  Mollusc, and as it enlarges protrudes the greater part of its bulk into the lumen, and may become
  free therein, or pass into the coelom. The attached part is often enlarged into a sort of grapple
  armed with spines, the "epimerite"; this contains only sarcocyte, the other layers being absent.
  The freely projecting body is usually divided by an ingrowth of the myocyte into a front segment
  ("protomerite"), and a rear one ("deutomerite"), with the nucleus usually in the latter. In this
  state the cell is termed a "cephalont." Conjugation is frequent, but apparently is not always
  connected with <span class="pagenum" id="page99"><span class="smaller">{99}</span></span>syngamy
  or spore-formation; sometimes from two to five may be aggregated into a chain or "syzygy." The
  number of cases in which a syngamic process between two cells has been observed is constantly
  being increased. In <i>Stylorhynchus</i> (Fig. 33) the conjugation at first resembles that of
  <i>Monocystis</i>, but the actual pairing-cells are bisexually differentiated into sperms in the
  one parent, and oospheres in the other; it is remarkable that here the pear-shaped sperms are
  apparently larger than the oospheres. In <i>Pterocephalus</i> the chief difference is that the
  sperms are minute.<a id="NtA_106" href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> In all cases of
  spore-formation the epimerite is lost and the septum disappears; in this state the cell is termed
  a sporont. Sometimes the epiplasm of the sporont forms tubes ("sporoducts"), which project through
  the cyst-wall and give exit to the spores, as in <i>Gregarina</i> (Fig. 32, C), a parasite in the
  beetle <i>Blaps</i>.</p>

  <p>Gregarines infest most groups of Invertebrates except Sponges and perhaps Coelenterates, the
  only exception cited being that of <i>Epizoanthus glacialis</i>, a Zoantharian (p. <a
  href="#page406">406</a>). They appear to be relatively harmless and are not known to induce
  epidemics.</p>

  <p>The <b>Coccidiaceae</b> never attain so high a degree of cellular differentiation as the
  Gregarines, which may be due to their habitat; for in the growing state they are intracellular
  parasites. Their life-history shows a double cycle, which has been most thoroughly worked out in
  <b>Coccidiidae</b> by Schaudinn and Siedlecki in parasites of our common Centipedes. We take that
  of <i>Coccidium schubergi</i> (in <i>Lithobius forficatus</i><a id="NtA_107"
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a>), beginning with the sporozoite, which is liberated from the
  spores taken in with the food, in the gut of the Centipede. This active sickle-shaped cell (Fig.
  34, <i>l</i>) enters an epithelial cell of the mid-gut, and grows therein till it attains its full
  size (<i>a</i>), when it is termed a "schizont"; for it segments (Gk. <span title="schiz&ocirc;"
  class="fsn">&sigma;&chi;&#x03AF;&zeta;&omega;</span>, "I split") superficially into a large number
  of sickle-shaped zoospores, the "merozoites" (<i>c</i>), resembling the sporozoites. The
  segmentation is superficial, so that there may remain a large mass of residual epiplasm. The
  merozoites are set free by the destruction of the epithelium-cell in which they were formed, and
  which becomes disorganised, like the residual epiplasm. Each merozoite may repeat the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page100"><span class="smaller">{100}</span></span>behaviour of the sporozoite,
  so that the disease spreads freely, and becomes acute after several reinfections. After a time the
  adult parasites, instead of becoming schizonts and simply forming merozoites by division,
  differentiate into cells that undergo a binary sexual differentiation. Some cells, the "oocytes"
  (<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>), escape into the gut, and the nucleus undergoes changes by which some of its
  substance (or an abortive daughter-nucleus) is expelled to the exterior (<i>f</i>), such a cell is
  now an "oogamete" or oosphere. Others, again, are spermatogones (<i>h</i>): each when full grown
  on escaping into the gut commences a division (<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>), like that of the schizonts.
  The products of this division or segment-cells are the flagellate sperms (<i>s</i>): they are more
  numerous and more minute than the merozoites produced by the schizonts, and are attracted to the
  oosphere by chemiotaxy (p. <a href="#page23">23</a>), and one enters it and fuses with it
  (<i>g</i>). The oosperm, zygote or fertilised egg, thus formed invests itself with a dense
  cyst-wall, as a "oospore" (<i>k</i>), its contents form one or more (2, 4, 8, etc.) spores; and
  each spore forms again one, two, or four sickle-shaped zoospores ("sporozoites"), destined to be
  liberated for a fresh cycle of parasitic life when the spores are swallowed by another host.</p>

  <p>In some cases the oogametes are at first oblong, like ordinary merozoites, and round off in the
  gut. The microgametocyte, or spermatogone, has the same character, but is smaller; it applies
  itself like a cap to one pole of the oogamete, which has rounded off; it then divides into four
  sperms, whose cytoplasm is not sharply separated; one of these then separates from the common
  mass, enters the oogamete, and so conjugation is effected, with an oosperm as its result. This
  latter mode of conjugation is that of <i>Adelea ovata</i> and <i>Coccidium lacazei</i>: the former
  is probably the more primitive and the commoner. The sperms <span class="pagenum"
  id="page102"><span class="smaller">{102}</span></span>of Coccidiidae, when free, usually possess
  two long flagella, either both anterior, or a very long one in front and a short one behind, both
  turned backwards.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Coccidium</i> affects many animals, and one species in particular, <i>C.
  cuniculi</i> Rivolta, attacks the liver of young rabbits,<a id="NtA_108"
  href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> giving rise to the disease "coccidiosis." <i>Coccidium</i> may
  also produce a sort of dysentery in cattle on the Alpine pastures of Switzerland; and cases of
  human coccidiosis are by no means unknown. <i>Coccidium</i>-like bodies have been demonstrated in
  the human disease, "molluscum contagiosum," and the "oriental sore" of Asia; similar bodies have
  also been recorded in smallpox and vaccinia, malignant tumours and even syphilis, but their nature
  is not certainly known; some of these are now referred to Flagellata (see p. <a
  href="#page121">121</a>).</p>

  <p>Closely allied to the Coccidiidae are the <b>Haemosporidae</b>, dwellers in the blood of
  various cold-blooded Vertebrates,<a id="NtA_109" href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> and entering
  the corpuscles as sporozoites or merozoites to attain the full size, when they divide by
  schizogony; they are freed like those of the next family by the breaking up of the corpuscle. The
  merozoites were described by Gaule (1879) as "vermicles" ("W&uuml;rmchen"), and regarded by him as
  peculiar segregation-products of the blood; though Lankester had described the same species in the
  Frog's blood as early as 1871, with a full recognition of its true character. His name,
  <i>Drepanidium</i>, has had to give way, having been appropriated to another animal, and has been
  aptly replaced by that of <i>Lankesterella</i>. The sexual process of <i>Karyolysus</i> has been
  found to take place in a Tick, that of <i>Haemogregarina</i> in a Leech, thus presenting a close
  analogy to the next group, which only differs in its less definite form in the active state, and
  in the lack of a cell-wall during brood-formation.</p>

  <p>Laveran was the first to describe a member of the <span class="pagenum" id="page103"><span
  class="smaller">{103}</span></span><b>Acystosporidae</b>, in 1880, as an organism always to be
  found in the blood of patients suffering from malarial fever; this received the rather
  inappropriate name of <i>Plasmodium</i>, which, by a pedantic adherence to the laws of priority,
  has been used by systematists as a generic name. Golgi demonstrated the coincidence of the stages
  of the intermittent fever with those of the life-cycle of the parasite in the patient, the
  maturation of the schizont and liberation of the sporozoites coinciding with the fits of fever.
  Manson, who had already shown that the Nematodes of the blood that give rise to Filarial
  haematuria (see Vol. II. p. 149) have an alternating life in the gnats or mosquitos of the common
  genus <i>Culex</i>,<a id="NtA_110" href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> in 1896 suggested to Ronald
  Ross that the same might apply to this parasite, and thus inspired a most successful work. The
  hypothesis had old prejudices in its favour, for in many parts there was a current belief that
  sleeping under mosquito-netting at least helped other precautions against malaria. Ross found
  early in his investigations that <i>Culex</i> was a good host for the allied genus
  <i>Haemoproteus</i> or <i>Proteosoma</i>, parasitic in birds, but could neither inoculate man with
  fever nor be inoculated from man. He found, however, that the malaria germs from man underwent
  further changes in the stomach of a "dappled-wing mosquito," that is, as we have since learned, a
  member of the genus <i>Anopheles</i>. Thenceforward the study advanced rapidly, and a number of
  inquirers, including Grassi, Koch, MacCallum (who discovered the true method of sexual union in
  <i>Halteridium</i><a id="NtA_111" href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a>), and Ross himself,
  completed his discovery by supplying a complete picture of the life-cycles of the malaria-germs.
  Unfortunately, there has been a most unhappy rivalry as to the priority of the share in each
  fragment of the discovery, whose history is summarised by Nuttall, we believe, with perfect
  fairness.<a id="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The merozoite is always amoeboid, and in this state enters the blood corpuscle; herein it
  attains its full size, as a schizont, becoming filled with granules of "melanin" or black pigment,
  probably a decomposition product of the red colouring matter (haemoglobin).</p>

  <p>The nucleus of the schizont now divides repeatedly, and then the schizont segments into a flat
  brood of germs (merozoites), relatively few in the parasite of quartan fever (<i>Haemamoeba
  malariae</i>, Fig. 35, E-G), many in that of tertian (<i>H. vivax</i>, Fig. 35, M). These
  brood-cells escape and behave for the most part as before. But after the disease has persisted for
  some time we find that in the genus <i>Haemamoeba</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page105"><span
  class="smaller">{105}</span></span>which induces the common malarial fevers of temperate regions,
  certain of the full-grown germs, instead of behaving as schizonts, pass, as it were, to rest as
  round cells; while in the allied genus <i>Laverania</i>, (<i>Haemomenas</i>, Ross) these
  resting-cells are crescentic, with blunt horns, and are usually termed half-moons (Fig. 35, O, T),
  characteristic of the bilious or pernicious remittent fevers of the tropics and of the warmer
  temperate regions in summer. These round or crescent-shaped cells are the gametocytes, which only
  develop further in the drawn blood, whether under the microscope, protected against evaporation,
  or in the stomach of the <i>Anopheles</i>: the crescents become round, and then they, like the
  already round ones of <i>Haemamoeba</i>, differentiate in exactly the same way as the
  corresponding cells of <i>Coccidium schubergi</i>. The female cell only exhibits certain changes
  in its nucleus to convert it into an oosphere: the male emits a small number of sperms, long
  flagellum-like bodies, each with a nucleus; and these, by their wriggling, detach themselves from
  the central core, no longer nucleated. The male gametogonium with its protruded sperms was termed
  the "<i>Polymitus</i> form," and was by some regarded as a degeneration-form, until MacCallum
  discovered that a "flagellum" regularly undergoes sexual fusion with an oosphere in
  <i>Halteridium</i>, as has since been found in the other genera. The oosperm (Y) so formed is at
  first motile ("ookinete"), as it is in Haemosporidae, and passes into the epithelium of the
  stomach of the gnat and then through the wall, acquiring a cyst-wall and finally projecting into
  the coelom (<i>a-e</i>). Here it segments into a number of spheres ("zygotomeres" of Ross)
  corresponding to the Coccidian spores, but which never acquire a proper wall (<i>f</i>). These by
  segmentation produce at their surface an immense quantity of elongated sporozoites (the
  "zygotoblasts" or "blasts" of Ross, Fig. 35, <i>g</i>), these are ultimately freed by the
  disappearance of the cyst-wall of the oosperm, pass through the coelom into the salivary gland
  (<i>h</i>), and are discharged with its secretion into the wound that the gnat inflicts in biting.
  In the blood the blasts follow the ordinary development of merozoites in the blood corpuscle, and
  the patient shows the corresponding signs of fever. This has been completely proved by rearing the
  insect from the egg, feeding it on the blood of a patient in whose blood there were ascertained to
  be the germs of a definite species of <span class="pagenum" id="page106"><span
  class="smaller">{106}</span></span><i>Haemamoeba</i>, sending it to England, where it was made to
  bite Dr. Manson's son, who had never had fever and whose blood on repeated examination had proved
  free from any germs. In the usual time he had a well-defined attack of the fever corresponding to
  that germ, and his blood on examination revealed the <i>Haemamoeba</i> of the proper type. A few
  doses of quinine relieved him of the consequences of his mild martyrdom to science. Experiments of
  similar character but of less rigorous nature had been previously made in Italy with analogous
  results. Again, it has been shown that by mere precautions against the bites of <i>Anopheles</i>,
  and these only, all residents who adopted them during the malarious season in the most unhealthy
  districts of Italy escaped fever during a whole season; while those who did not adopt the
  precautions were badly attacked.<a id="NtA_113" href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Anopheles</i> flourishes in shallow puddles, or small vessels such as tins, etc., the pools
  left by dried-up brooks and torrents, as well as larger masses of stagnant water, canals, and
  slow-flowing streams. Sticklebacks and minnows feed freely on the larvae and keep down the numbers
  of the species; where the fish are not found, the larvae may be destroyed by pouring paraffin oil
  on the surface of the water and by drainage. A combination of protective measures in Freetown
  (Sierra Leone) and other ports on the west coast of Africa, Ismailia, and elsewhere, has met with
  remarkable success during the short time for which it has been tried; and it seems not improbable,
  that as the relatively benign intermittent fevers have within the last century been banished from
  our own fen and marsh districts, so the Guinea coast may within the next decade lose its sad title
  of "The White Man's Grave."</p>

  <p>So closely allied to this group in form, habit, and life-cycle are some species of the
  Flagellate genus <i>Trypanosoma</i>, that in their less active states they have been
  unhesitatingly placed here (see p. <a href="#page119">119</a>). Schaudinn has seen Trypanosomic
  characters in the "blasts" of this group, which apparently is the most primitive of the Sporozoa
  and a direct offshoot of the Flagellates.</p>

  <p>The <b>Myxosporidiaceae</b> (Fig. 36) are parasitic in various <span class="pagenum"
  id="page107"><span class="smaller">{107}</span></span>cold-blooded animals. They are at least
  binucleate in the youngest free state, and become large and multinucleate apocytes, which may bud
  off outgrowths as well as reproduce by spores. The spores of the apocyte are not produced by
  simultaneous breaking up, but by successive differentiation. A single nucleus aggregates around
  itself a limited portion of the cytoplasm, and this again forms a membrane, becoming an archespore
  or a "pansporoblast," destined to produce two spores; within this, nuclear division takes place so
  as to form about eight nuclei, two of which are extruded as abortive, and of the other six, three
  are used up in the formation of each of the two spores. Of these three nuclei in each spore, two
  form nematocysts, like those of a Coelenterate (p. <a href="#page246">246</a> f.), at the expense
  of the surrounding plasm; while the third nucleus divides to form the two final nuclei of the
  reproductive body. The whole aggregate of the reproductive body and the two nematocysts is
  enveloped in a bivalve shell. In what we may call germination, the nematocysts eject a thread that
  serves for attachment, the valves of the shell open, and the binucleate mass crawls out and grows
  afresh. <i>Nosema bombycis</i> N&auml;geli (the spore of which has a single nematocyst) is the organism
  of the "P&eacute;brine" of the silkworm, which was estimated to have caused a total loss in France of
  some &pound;40,000,000 before Pasteur investigated the malady and prescribed the effectual cure, or
  rather precaution against its spread. This consisted in crushing each mother in water after it had
  laid its eggs and seeking for p&eacute;brine germs. If the mother proved to be infected, her eggs were
  destroyed, as the eggs she had laid were certain to be also tainted. Balbiani completed the study
  of the organism from a morphological standpoint. Some Myxosporidiaceae produce destructive
  epidemics in fish.</p>

  <p>The modes of nutrition are threefold: the simplest forms live in liquids containing decaying
  organic matter which they absorb through their surface ("saprophytic"): others take in food either
  <i>Amoeba</i> fashion, or into a vacuole formed for the purpose, or into a definite mouth
  ("holozoic"): others again have coloured plastids, green or brown or yellow ("holophytic"), having
  the plant's faculty of manufacturing their own food-supply. But we meet with species that show
  chromatophores at one time and lack them at another; or, again, the same individual
  (<i>Euglena</i>) may pass from holozoic life to saprophytic (<i>Paramoeba</i>, some
  Dinoflagellates) as conditions alter.</p>

  <p>Many secrete a stalk at the hinder end: by "continuous" formation of this, without rupture at
  fission, a branching colony is formed (<i>Polyoeca</i>). This stalk may have a varying
  consistency. In <i>Anthophysa</i> (Fig. 37, <span class="smaller">13</span>) it appears to be due
  to the welding of excrementitious particles voided at the hinder end of the body with a gelatinous
  excretion; but the division of the stalk is here occasional or intermittent, so that the cells are
  found in tufts at the apex of the branches. A corresponding secretion, gelatinous or chitinous,
  around the body of the cell forms a cup or "theca," within which the cell lies quite free or
  sticking to it by its surface, or attached to it by a rigid or contractile thread. The theca,
  again, may assume the form of a mere gelatinous mass in which the cell-bodies may be completely
  plunged, so that only the flagella protrude, as in Volvocidae, <i>Proterospongia</i> (Fig. 75, p.
  <a href="#page182">182</a>), and <i>Rhipidodendron</i> (Fig. 37, <span class="smaller">14</span>).
  Often this jelly assumes the form of a fan (<i>Phalansterium</i>), the branching tubes of which it
  is composed lying for some way alongside, and ultimately diverging. In <i>Hydrurus</i>, the
  branching jelly assumes the form of a branching Confervoid.<a id="NtA_117"
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The cell-body may be bounded by an ill-defined plasmatic layer in Chrysomonadaceae and some
  Protomastigaceae,<a id="NtA_118" href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> or it may form a plasmatic
  membrane or "pellicle," sometimes very firm and tough, or striated as in Euglenaceae, or it may
  have a separate "cuticle" (in the holophytic species formed of cellulose), or even a bivalve or
  multivalve shell of distinct plates, hinged or overlapping (<i>Cryptoglena</i>, <i>Phacotus</i>,
  Dinoflagellates). The wall of the <span class="pagenum" id="page114"><span
  class="smaller">{114}</span></span>Coccolithophoridae, a family of Chrysomonadaceae, is
  strengthened by embedded calcareous spicules ("coccoliths," "cyatholiths," "rhabdoliths"), which
  in the most complex forms (cyatholiths) are like a shirt-stud, traversed by a tube passing through
  the stem and opening at both ends. These organisms<a id="NtA_119"
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> constitute a large proportion of the plankton; the spicules
  isolated, or in their original state of aggregation ("coccospheres," "rhabdospheres"), enter
  largely into the composition of deep-sea calcareous oozes. They occur fossil from Cambrian times
  (Potsdam sandstone of Michigan and Canada), and are in some strata extremely abundant, 800,000
  occurring to the mm. cube in an Eocene marl.</p>

  <p>The Silicoflagellates have siliceous skeletons resembling that of many <i>Radiolaria</i>, to
  which they were referred until the living organism was described (see pp. <a
  href="#page79">79</a>, <a href="#page86">86</a> f.).</p>

  <p>The flagellum has been shown by Fischer to have one of two forms: either it is whip-like, the
  stick, alone visible in the fresh specimen, being seen when stained to be continued into a long
  lash, hitherto invisible; or the whole length is fringed with fine ciliiform lateral outgrowths.
  If single it is almost always protruded as a tugging organ ("tractellum");<a id="NtA_120"
  href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> the chief exceptions are the Craspedomonads, where it is
  posterior and acts as a scull ("pulsellum"), and some Dinoflagellates, where it is reversible in
  action or posterior. In addition to the anterior flagellum there may be one or more posterior
  ones, which trail behind as sense organs, or may anchor the cell by their tips. <i>Dallingeria</i>
  has two of these, and <i>Bodo saltans</i> a single anterior anchoring lash, by which they spring
  up and down against the organic d&eacute;bris among which they live, and disintegrate it. The numerous
  similar long flagella of the Trichonymphidae afford a transition in the genus <i>Pyrsonympha</i>
  to the short abundant cilia of <i>Opalina</i>, usually referred to the Ciliate Infusoria.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page115"><span class="smaller">{115}</span></span></div>

  <p>An undulating membrane occurs, sometimes passing into the flagellum in certain genera, all
  parasitic, such as <i>Trypanosoma</i> (incl. <i>Herpetomonas</i>), <i>Trichomonas</i>,
  <i>Hexamitus</i>, and <i>Dinenympha</i>.</p>

  <p>In some cases the flagellum (or flagella) is inserted into a definite pit, which in allied
  forms is the mouth-opening. The contractile vacuole is present in the fresh-water forms, but not
  in all the marine ones, nor in the endoparasites. It may be single or surrounded by a ring of
  minute "formative" vacuoles or discharge into a permanently visible "reservoir." This again may
  discharge directly to the surface or through the pit or canal in which the flagellum takes origin
  (<i>Euglena</i>).</p>

  <p>The "chromatophore" may be a single or double plate, or multiple.<a id="NtA_121"
  href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> In the peculiar form <i>Paramoeba</i> the chromatophore may
  degenerate and be reproduced anew. It often encloses rounded or polygonal granules of uncoloured
  plasma, very refractive, known as "pyrenoids." These, like the chromatophores, multiply by direct
  fission. The "reserves" may be (1) fat-globules; (2) granules of a possibly proteid substance
  termed "leucosin"; (3) a carbohydrate termed "paramylum," differing slightly from starch (see p.
  <a href="#page95">95</a>); (4) true starch, which is usually deposited in minute granules to form
  an investment for the pyrenoid when such is present.</p>

  <p>A strongly staining granule is usually present in the plasma near the base of the flagellum.
  This we may term a "blepharoplast" or a "centrosome" in the wider sense.</p>

  <p><b>Fission</b> is usually longitudinal in the active state; a few exceptions are recorded.
  Encystment is not uncommon; and in the coloured forms the cyst-wall is of cellulose. Division in
  the cyst is usually multiple;<a id="NtA_122" href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> in the coloured
  forms, however, vegetative growth often alternates with division, giving rise to plant-like
  bodies. <i>Polytoma</i> and other Chlamydomonadidae multiply by "brood-formation" in the active
  state; the blepharoplast, as Dangeard suggests, persisting to continue the motion of the flagella
  of the parent, while the rest of the plasm divides to form the brood. <b>Conjugation</b> has been
  observed in many species. In some species of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> it takes place after one or both
  of the two <span class="pagenum" id="page116"><span class="smaller">{116}</span></span>cells have
  come to rest, but in most cases it occurs between active cells. We find every transition between
  equal unions and differentiated sexual unions, as we shall see in discussing the Volvocaceae.<a
  id="NtA_123" href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> The "coupled-cell" differs in behaviour in the
  different groups, but almost always goes to rest and encysts at once, whatever it may do
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>The <b>life-history</b> of many Flagellates has been successfully studied by various observers,
  and has shed a flood of light on many of the processes of living beings that were hitherto
  obscure. The first studies were carried through by the patient labours of Drysdale and Dallinger.
  A delicate mechanical stage enabled the observer to keep in the field of view a single Flagellate,
  and, when it divided into two, to follow up one of the products. A binocular eye-piece saved much
  fatigue, and enabled the observers to exchange places without losing sight of the special
  Flagellate under observation; for the one who came to relieve would put one eye to the instrument
  and recognise the individual Flagellate under view as he passed his hand round to the mechanism of
  the stage before the first watcher finally relinquished his place at the end of the spell of work.

  <p>The life-cycles varied considerably in length. It was in every case found that after a series
  of fissions the species ultimately underwent conjugation (more or less unequal or bisexual in
  character);<a id="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> the zygote encysted; and within the
  cyst the protoplasmic body underwent brood-formation, the outcome of which was a mass of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page118"><span class="smaller">{118}</span></span>spores discharged by the
  rupture of the cyst (Fig. 38). These spores grow from a size too minute for resolution by our
  microscopes into the ordinary flagellate form. They withstand the effects of drying, if this be
  effected immediately on their escape from the ruptured cyst; so that it is probable that each
  spore has itself a delicate cyst-wall and an aplanospore, from which a single zoospore escapes.
  The complex cycle, of course, comprises the whole course from spore-formation to spore-formation.
  Such complete and regular "life-histories," each characteristic of the species, were the final
  argument against those who held to the belief that spontaneous generation of living beings took
  place in infusions of decomposing organic matter.</p>

  <p>Previous to the work of these observers it had been almost universally believed that the
  temperature of boiling water was adequate to kill all living germs, and that any life that
  appeared in a closed vessel after boiling must be due to spontaneous change in its contents. But
  they now showed that, while none of the species studied resisted exposure <i>in the active
  condition</i> to a temperature of 138&deg;-140&deg; F., the spores only succumbed, in liquid, to
  temperatures that might even reach 268&deg; F., or when dry, even 300&deg; F. or more. Such facts explain
  the constant occurrence of one or more such minute species in liquids putrefying under ordinary
  conditions, the spores doubtless being present in the dust of the air. Very often several species
  may co-exist in one infusion; but they separate themselves into different zones, according to
  their respective need for air, when a drop of the liquid is placed on the slide and covered for
  examination. Dallinger<a id="NtA_125" href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> has made a series of
  experiments on the resistance of these organisms in their successive cycles to a gradual rise of
  temperature. Starting with a liquid containing three distinct species, which grew and multiplied
  normally at 60&deg; F., he placed it under conditions in which he could slowly raise the temperature.
  While all the original inmates would have perished at 142&deg; F., he succeeded in finally producing
  races that throve at 158&deg; F., a scalding heat, when an accident put an end to that series of
  experiments. In no instance was the temperature raised so much as to kill off the beings, so that
  the increased tolerance of their descendants was due not, as might have been anticipated, to
  selection of those that best resisted, but to the inheritance of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page119"><span class="smaller">{119}</span></span>an increased toleration and resistance from
  one generation or cycle to another.</p>

  <p>As we noted above (p. <a href="#page40">40</a>), the study of the Flagellates has been largely
  in the hands of botanists. After the work of B&uuml;tschli in Bronn's <i>Thier-Reich</i>, Klebs<a
  id="NtA_126" href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> took up their study; and the principal monographs
  during the last decade have appeared in Engler and Prantl's <i>Pflanzenfamilien</i>, where Senn<a
  id="NtA_127" href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> treats the Flagellates generally, Wille<a
  id="NtA_128" href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> the Volvocaceae, and Sch&uuml;tt the "Peridiniales" or
  Dinoflagellata;<a id="NtA_129" href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> while only the Cystoflagellata,
  with but two genera, have been left to the undisputed sway of the zoologists.<a id="NtA_130"
  href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Among this group the majority are saprophytes, found in water containing putrefying matter or
  bacteria. The forms so carefully studied by Dallinger and Drysdale belong to the genera
  <i>Bodo</i>, <i>Cercomonas</i>, <i>Tetramitus</i>, <i>Monas</i>, and <i>Dallingeria</i>. Many
  others are parasites in the blood or internal cavities of higher animals, some apparently
  harmless, such as <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>, parasitic in man, others of singular malignity.
  <i>Costia necatrix</i>, infesting the epithelial scales of fresh-water fish, often devastates
  hatcheries. The genus <i>Trypanosoma</i>, Gruby, contributes a number of parasites, giving rise to
  deadly disease in man and beast.<a id="NtA_131" href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> <i>T.
  lewisii</i> is common in Rodents, but is relatively harmless. <i>T. evansii</i> is the cause of
  the Surra disease of Ruminants in India, and is apparently communicated by the bites of "large
  brown flies" (almost certainly Breeze Flies or Tabanidae, Vol. VI. p. 481). <i>T. brucei</i>,
  transferred to cattle by the Tsetse Fly, <i>Glossina morsitans</i> (see Vol. VI. Fig. 244, p. 513)
  in Equatorial Africa, is the cause of the deadly Nagana disease, which renders whole tracts of
  country impassable to ox or horse. Other Trypanosomic diseases of animals are, in Algeria and the
  Punjab, "dourine," infecting horses and dogs; in South America, Mal de Caderas (falling-sickness),
  an epidemic paralysis of cattle. During the printing of this book, much additional knowledge has
  been gained on this genus and the diseases it engenders. The Trypanosomic <span class="pagenum"
  id="page120"><span class="smaller">{120}</span></span>fever recently recognised on the West Coast
  has been found to be the early stage of the sleeping-sickness, that well-known and most deadly
  epidemic of Tropical Africa. Through the researches of Castellani, Nabarro, and especially Colonel
  and Mrs. Bruce, we know now that the parasite <i>T. gambiense</i> is transferred by an
  intermediate host, a kind of Tsetse Fly (<i>Glossina palpalis</i>). Schaudinn's full study of a
  parasite of the blood corpuscles of the Owl has shown that while in its intracorpuscular state it
  resembles closely the malarial parasites in behaviour, and in its schizogenic multiplication, so
  that it was considered an Acystosporidian, under the name of <i>Halteridium</i>, it is really a
  <i>Trypanosoma</i>;<a id="NtA_132" href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> for the accomplishment of
  successful sexual reproduction it requires transference to the gut of a gnat (<i>Culex</i>). The
  germs may infect the ovary, and give the offspring of the insect the innate power of infecting
  Owls. Thus a new light is shed on the origin of the Coccidiaceae, whose "blasts" in the insect
  host resemble <i>Trypanosoma</i> in their morphology.</p>

  <p>The human Tick fever of the Western United States and the epizootic Texas fever are known to be
  due to blood parasites of the genus <i>Piroplasma</i> (<i>Babesia</i>), of which the free state is
  that of a Trypanosome. It appears certain that Texas fever, though due to Tick bites, is not
  transferred directly from one beast to another by the same Tick; but the offspring of a female
  Tick that has sucked an infected ox contains Trypanosome germs, and will by their bites infect
  other animals. <span class="pagenum" id="page121"><span class="smaller">{121}</span></span>It
  would seem probable that the virulence of the Persian Tick (<i>Argas persica</i>) is due to
  similar causes. The Indian maladies known as "Kala Azar" and "Oriental Sore" are characterised by
  blood parasites, at first called after their discoverer the "Leishman bodies," which have proved
  to be the effects of a <i>Piroplasma</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Trypanosoma</i> is distinguished by the expansion of its flagellum into an undulating
  membrane, that runs down the edge of the body, and may project behind as a second lash. In this
  membrane run eight fine muscular filaments, or myonemes, four on either surface, within the
  undulating membrane; at their lower end they are all connected with a rounded body, the
  "blepharoplast," which is here in its origin, as well as in its behaviour in reproductive
  processes, a true modified nucleus, comparable in some respects, as was first noted by Plimmer and
  Rose Bradford,<a id="NtA_133" href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> with the micronucleus of the
  Infusoria. Part of the segmentation spindle persists in the form of a filament uniting the
  blepharoplast with the large true functional nucleus (Fig. 39, <i>a-f</i>).</p>

  <p>The blood of patients suffering from relapsing fever contains a fine wriggling parasite, which
  was described as a Schizomycete, allied to the bacteria, and hitherto termed <i>Spirochaeta
  obermeieri</i>. Schaudinn has shown that this and other similar blood parasites are closely allied
  to <i>Trypanosoma</i>; and since the original genus was founded on organisms of putrefaction which
  are undoubtedly Schizomycetes, Vuillemin has suggested the name <i>Treponema</i>. <i>T.
  pallidum</i> is found in syphilitic patients, and appears to be responsible for their illness.<a

  <p>The Craspedomonadidae (often called Choanoflagellates, Fig. 40) are a group whose true nature
  was elucidated some forty years ago by the American zoologist, H. James-Clark. They are attached
  either to a substratum, by a stalk produced by the base of the cell, or to other members of the
  same colony; they are distinguished by the protrusion of the cytoplasm around the base of the
  single flagellum into a pellucid funnel,<a id="NtA_135" href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> in
  which the plasma is in constant motion, though the funnel retains its shape and size, except when,
  as sometimes happens, it is retracted.</p>

  <p>The agitation of the flagellum determines a stream of water upwards along the outer walls of
  the funnel; and the food-particles brought along adhere to the outside of the funnel, and are
  carried by its streaming movement to the basal constriction, where they are swallowed by the
  plasma, which appears to form a swallowing vacuole at that point. Longitudinal fission is the
  ordinary mode of reproduction, extending up through the funnel. If the two so formed continue to
  produce a stalk, the result is the formation of a tree-like stem, whose twigs bear at the ends the
  funnelled cells, or "collar-cells" as they are usually called. In <i>Salpingoeca</i>, as in so
  many other Flagellates, each cell forms a cup or theca, often of most graceful vase-like outline,
  the rim being elegantly turned back. <i>Proterospongia</i> (Fig. 75, p. <a
  href="#page182">182</a>) secretes a gelatinous investment for the colony, which is attached to
  solid bodies. In this species, according to Saville Kent, the central members of the colony
  retract their collar, lose their flagellum, become amoeboid, and finally undergo brood-formation
  to produce minute zoospores. This is the form which by its differentiation recalls the Sponges,
  and has been regarded as a <span class="pagenum" id="page123"><span
  class="smaller">{123}</span></span>transition towards them; for the flagellate, nutritive cells of
  the Sponges are provided with a collar, which exists in no other group of Metazoa (see pp. <a

  <p>Of the life-history of the Trichonymphidae,<a id="NtA_136" href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a>
  all of which are parasitic in the alimentary canal of Insects, especially Termites or White Ants
  (Vol. V. p. 356), nothing is known. Some of them have a complete investment of motile flagella,
  like enormously long cilia, which in <i>Dinenympha</i> appear to coalesce into four longitudinal
  undulating membranes. <i>Lophomonas</i> inhabits the gut of the Cockroach and Mole-cricket. The
  Opalinidae have also a complete investment of cilia, which are short, and give the aspect of a
  Ciliate to the animal, which is common in the rectum of Amphibia, and dies when transferred to
  water. But despite the outward resemblance, the nuclei, of which there may be as many as 200, are
  all similar, and consequently this group cannot be placed among the Infusoria at all.
  <i>Opalina</i> has no mouth nor contractile vacuole. It multiplies by dividing <span
  class="pagenum" id="page124"><span class="smaller">{124}</span></span>irregularly and at
  intervals, resolving finally into 1-nucleate fragments, which encyst and pass into the water. When
  swallowed the cyst dissolves, its contents enlarge, and ultimately assume the adult form.<a
  id="NtA_137" href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Maupasia</i> has a partial investment of cilia, a single long flagellum and mouth, a
  contractile vesicle, and a single simple nucleus. It seems to find an appropriate place near the
  two above groups, though it is free, and possesses a mouth.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Among the Euglenaceae, <i>Euglena viridis</i> is a very common form, giving the green colour to
  stagnant or slow-flowing ditches and puddles in light places, especially when contaminated by a
  fair amount of dung, as by the overflow of a pig-sty, in company with a few hardy Rotifers, such
  as <i>Hydatina senta</i> (Vol. II. Fig. 106, p. 199) and <i>Brachionus</i>. <i>Euglena</i> is
  about 0.1 mm. in length when fully extended, oval, pointed behind, obliquely truncate in front,
  with a flagellum arising from the pharyngeal pit. It shows a peculiar wriggling motion, waves of
  transverse constriction passing along the body from end to end, as well as flexures in different
  meridians. Such motions are termed "euglenoid." The front part is colourless, but under a low
  <span class="pagenum" id="page125"><span class="smaller">{125}</span></span>power the rest of the
  cell is green, owing to the numerous chlorophyll bodies or chloroplasts. The outermost layer of
  the cytoplasm shows a somewhat spiral longitudinal striation, possibly due to muscular fibrils.
  The interior contains many laminated plates of paramylum, and a large single nucleus. At the front
  of the body at the base of the flagellum is a red "eye-spot" on the dorsal side of the
  pharynx-tube or pit, from which the flagellum protrudes. Wager has shown that this tube receives,
  also on its dorsal side, the opening of a large vacuole, sometimes called the reservoir, for into
  it discharges the contractile vacuole (or vacuoles). The eye-spot is composed of numerous
  granules, containing the vegetal colouring matter "haematochrome." It embraces the lower or
  posterior side of the communication between the tube and the reservoir. The flagellum has been
  traced by Wager through the tube into the reservoir, branching into two roots where it enters the
  aperture of communication, and these are inserted on the wall of the reservoir at the side
  opposite the eye-spot. But on one of the roots near the bifurcation is a dilatation which lies
  close against the eye-spot, so that it can receive the light reaction. <i>Euglena</i> is an
  extremely phototactic organism. It shows various wrigglings along the longitudinal axis, and
  transverse waves of contraction and expansion may pass from pole to pole.<a id="NtA_138"
  href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Among the Chrysomonadaceae the genus <i>Zooxanthella</i>, Brandt, has already been described
  under the Radiolaria (p. <a href="#page86">86</a>), in the jelly of which it is symbiotic. It also
  occurs in similar union in the marine Ciliates, <i>Vorticella sertulariae</i> and <i>Scyphidia
  scorpaenae</i>, and in <i>Millepora</i> (p. <a href="#page261">261</a>) and many Anthozoa (pp. <a

  phenomena of "red snow" and "bloody rain." The type genus, <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, is remarkable for
  the variations from species to species in the character and behaviour of the gametes. Sometimes
  they are equal, at other times of two sizes. In some species they fuse immediately on
  approximation, in the naked active state; in others, they encyst on approaching, and unite by the
  emission of a fertilising tube, <span class="pagenum" id="page126"><span

  <p>Of the Volvocidae, <i>Volvox</i> (Fig. 44) is the largest and most conspicuous genus. Its
  colony forms a globe the size of a pin's head, floating on the surface of ponds, drains, or even
  puddles or water-barrels freely open to the light. It has what may be called a skeleton of
  gelatinous matter,<a id="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> condensed towards the
  surface into a denser layer in which the minute cells are scattered. These have each an eye-spot,
  a contractile vacuole, and two flagella, by the combined action of which the colony is propelled.
  Delicate boundary lines in the colonial wall mark out the proper investment of each cell. The
  cells give off delicate plasmic threads which meet those of their neighbours, and form a bond
  between them. In that half of the hemisphere which is posterior in swimming, a few (five to eight)
  larger cells ("macrogonidia" of older writers) are evenly distributed, protruding as they increase
  in size into the central jelly. These as they grow segment to form a new colony.</p>

  <p>The divisions are only in two planes at right angles, so that the young colony is at first a
  plate, but as the cells multiply the plate bends up (as in the gastrulation of the double cellular
  plate of the Nematode <i>Cucullanus</i>, Vol. II. p. 136), and finally forms a hollow sphere
  bounded by a single layer of cells: the site of the original orifice may be traced even in the
  adult as a blank space larger than exists elsewhere. Among the cells of the young colony some
  cease to divide, but continue to grow at an early period, and these are destined to become in turn
  the mothers ("parthenogonidia") of a new colony; they begin segmenting before the colony of which
  they are cells is freed. The young colonies are ultimately liberated by the rupture of the sphere
  as small-sized spheres, which henceforth only grow by enlargement of the sphere as a whole, and
  the wider separation of the vegetative cells. Thus the vegetative cells soon cease to grow; all
  the supply of food material due to their living activities goes to the nourishment of the
  parthenogonidia, or the young colonies, as <span class="pagenum" id="page128"><span
  class="smaller">{128}</span></span>the case may be. These vegetative cells have therefore
  surrendered the power of fission elsewhere inherent in the Protist cell. Moreover, when the sphere
  ruptures for the liberation of the young colonies, it sinks and is doomed to death, whether
  because its light-loving cells are submerged in the ooze of the bottom, or because they have no
  further capacity for life. When conjugation is about to take place, it is the cells that otherwise
  would be parthenogonidia that either act as oospheres or divide as "spermogonia" to form a flat
  brood of minute yellow male cells ("sperms"). These resemble vegetative cells, in the possession
  of an eye-spot and two contractile vacuoles, but differ in the enormously enlarged nucleus which
  determines a beaked process in front. After one of these has fused with the female cell
  ("oosphere") the product ("oosperm") encysts, passes into a stage of profound rest, and finally
  gives rise to a new colony. The oospheres and sperm-broods may arise in the same colony or in
  distinct ones, according to the species.</p>

  <p>Before we consider the bearings of the syngamic processes of <i>Volvox</i>, we will study those
  presented by its nearer allies, which have the same habitat, but are much more minute. Three of
  these are well known, <i>Stephanosphaera</i>, <i>Pandorina</i>, and <i>Eudorina</i>, all of which
  have spherical colonies of from eight to thirty-two cells embedded at the surface of a sphere, and
  no differentiation into vegetative cells and parthenogonidia (or reproductive cells).</p>

  <p><i>Stephanosphaera</i> has its eight cells spindle shaped, and lying along equidistant
  meridians of its sphere; in vegetative reproduction each of these breaks up in its place to form a
  young colony, and the eight daughter-colonies are then freed. In conjugation, each cell of the
  colony breaks up into broods of 4, 8, 16, or 32 small gametes, which swim about within the general
  envelope, and pair and fuse two and two: this is "isogamous," "endogamous" conjugation. In
  <i>Pandorina</i> (Fig. 45) the cells are rounded, and are from 16 to 32 in each colony. The
  vegetative reproduction in this, as in <i>Eudorina</i>, is essentially the same as in
  <i>Stephanosphaera</i>. In conjugation the cells are set free, and are of three sizes in different
  colonies, small (S), medium (M), and large (L). The following fusions may occur: S &times; S, S &times; M, S &times;
  L, M &times; M, M &times; L. Thus the large are always female, as it were, the medium may play the part of
  male to the large, female to the small; the small are males to the medium and to the large. The
  medium <span class="pagenum" id="page129"><span class="smaller">{129}</span></span>and small are
  capable, each with its like, of equal, undifferentiated conjugation; so that we have a
  differentiation of sex far other than that of ordinary, binary sex. <i>Eudorina</i>, however, has
  attained to "binary sex," for the female cells are the ordinary vegetative cells, at most a little
  enlarged, and the male cells are formed by ordinary cells producing a large flat colony of
  sixty-four minute males or sperms. In some cases four cells at the apex of a colony are
  spermogonia, producing each a brood of sperms, while the rest are the oospheres. The transition to
  <i>Volvox</i> must have arisen through the sterilisation of the majority of cells of a colony for
  the better nutrition of the few that are destined alone for reproduction.</p>

  <p><i>Volvox</i>, as we have seen, has attained a specialisation entirely comparable to that of a
  Metazoon, where the segmentation of the fertilised ovum results in two classes of cells: those
  destined <span class="pagenum" id="page130"><span class="smaller">{130}</span></span>to form
  tissues, and condemned to ultimate death with the body as a whole, and those that ultimately give
  rise to the reproductive cells, ova, and sperms. But this is a mere parallelism, not indicating
  any sort of relationship: the oospores of the Volvocaceae show that tendency to an encysted state,
  in which fission takes place, that is so characteristic of Algae, and these again show the way to
  Cryptogams of a higher status. Thus, <i>Volvox</i>, despite the fact that in its free life and
  cellular differentiation it is the most animal of all known Flagellates, is yet, with the rest of
  the Volvocaceae, inseparable from the Vegetable Kingdom, and is placed here only because of the
  impossibility of cleaving the Flagellates into two.</p>

  <p>The Dinoflagellata (Figs. 46, 47) are often of exceptionally large dimensions in this class,
  attaining a maximum diameter of <span class="wnw">150 &micro;</span> (<span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">160</span>") and even <span class="wnw">375 &micro;</span>
  (<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">67</span>") in <i>Pyrocystis noctiluca</i>.
  The special character of the group is the presence of two flagella; the one, filiform, arises in a
  longitudinal groove, and extending its whole length projects behind the animal, and is the
  conspicuous organ of motion: the other, band-like, arises also in the longitudinal groove, but
  extends along a somewhat spiral transverse groove,<a id="NtA_140"
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> and never protrudes from it in life, executing undulating
  movements that simulate those of a girdle of cilia, or a continuous undulating membrane (Fig. 46).
  This appearance led to the old name "Cilioflagellata," which had of course to be abandoned when
  Klebs discovered the true structure.<a id="NtA_141" href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> There is a
  distinct cellulose membrane, sometimes silicified, to the ectoplasm, only interrupted by a bare
  space in the longitudinal groove, whence the flagella take origin. This cuticle is usually hard,
  sculptured, and divided into plates of definite form, bevelled and overlapping at their junction;
  occasionally the cell has been seen to moult them.</p>

  <p>A large vacuolar space, traversed by plasmic strings, separates the peripheral cytoplasm from
  the central, within which is the large nucleus. There are in most species one or more
  chromatophores, coloured by a yellowish or brownish pigment, which is a mixture of lipochromes,
  distinct from diatomin. In a few species the presence of these is not constant, and these species
  <span class="pagenum" id="page131"><span class="smaller">{131}</span></span>show variability as to
  their nutrition, which is sometimes holozoic. Under these conditions the cell can take in
  food-particles as bulky as the eggs of Rotifers and Copepods, by the protrusion of a pseudopod at
  the junction of the two grooves. As in most coloured forms an eye-spot is often present, a
  cup-shaped aggregation of pigment, with a lenticular refractive body in its hollow. A contractile
  vacuole, here termed a "pusule," occurs in many species, communicating with the longitudinal
  groove by a canal. Nematocysts (see p. <a href="#page246">246</a> f.) are present in
  <i>Polykrikos</i>, trichocysts (see p. <a href="#page142">142</a>) in several genera.</p>

  <p>Division is usually oblique, dividing the body into two dissimilar halves, each of which has to
  undergo a peculiar growth to reconstitute the missing portion, and complete the shell. The
  incomplete separation of the young cells leads to the formation of chains, notably in
  <i>Ceratium</i> and <i>Polykrikos</i>, the latter dividing transversely and occurring in chains of
  as many as eight. The process of division may take place when the cell is active, or in a cyst, as
  in <i>Pyrocystis</i> (Fig. 47). Again, encystment may precede multiple fission, resulting in the
  formation of a brood of minute swarmers. It has been suggested that these are capable of playing
  the part of gametes, and conjugating in pairs.<a id="NtA_142"
  href="#Nt_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Dinoflagellates are for the most part pelagic in habit, floating at the surface, and when
  abundant tinge the water of fresh-water lakes or even ponds red or brown. <i>Peridinium</i> (Fig.
  46) and <i>Ceratium</i> (the latter remarkable for the horn-like backward prolongations of the
  lower end) are common genera both in the sea <span class="pagenum" id="page132"><span
  class="smaller">{132}</span></span>and fresh-waters. <i>Gymnodinium pulvisculus</i> is sometimes
  parasitic in <i>Appendicularia</i> (Vol. VII. p. 68). <i>Polykrikos</i><a id="NtA_143"
  href="#Nt_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> has four transverse grooves, each with its flagellum, besides
  the terminal one. Many of the marine species are phosphorescent, and play a large part in the
  luminosity of the sea, and some give it a red colour.</p>

  <p>Several fossil forms have been described. <i>Peridinium</i> is certainly found fossil in the
  firestone of Delitzet, belonging to the Cretaceous. A full monograph of the group under the name
  "Peridiniales" was published by Sch&uuml;tt.<a id="NtA_144" href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Cystoflagellates contain only two genera,<a id="NtA_145"
  href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> <i>Noctiluca</i>, common at the surface of tranquil seas, to
  which, as its name implies, it gives phosphorescence, and <i>Leptodiscus</i>, found by R. Hertwig
  in the Mediterranean. <i>Noctiluca</i> is enormous for a Flagellate, for with the form of a
  miniature melon it measures about 1 mm. (<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">25</span>") or more in diameter. In the depression is the "oral cleft," from one end
  of which rises, by a broad base, a large coarse flagellum, as long as the body or longer and
  transversely striated. In front of the base of the flagellum are two lip-like <span
  class="pagenum" id="page133"><span class="smaller">{133}</span></span>prominences, of which one, a
  little firmer than the other, and transversely ridged, is called the tooth; at the junction of the
  two is a second, minute, flagellum, usually called the cilium. Behind these the oral groove has an
  oval space, the proper mouth; behind this, again, the oral groove is continued for some way, with
  a distinct rod-like ridge in its furrow. The whole body, including the big flagellum, is coated by
  a strong cuticular pellicle, except at the oblong mouth, and the lips and rod are mere thickenings
  of this. The cytoplasm has a reticulate arrangement: the mouth opens into a central aggregate,
  from which strands diverge branching as they recede to the periphery, where they pass into a
  continuous lining for the cuticular wall, liquid filling the interspaces. The whole arrangement is
  not unlike that found in many plant-cells, but the only other Protists in which it occurs are the
  Ciliata <i>Trachelius</i> (Fig. 56, p. <a href="#page153">153</a>) and <i>Loxodes</i>. The central
  mass contains the large nucleus. <i>Noctiluca</i> is an animal feeder, and expels its excreta
  through the mouth. The large flagellum is remarkable for the transverse striation of its plasma,
  especially on the ventral side. The cuticle may be moulted as in the Dinoflagellates. As a prelude
  to fission the external differentiations disappear, the nucleus divides in the plane of the oral
  groove, and a meridional constriction parts the two halves, the new external organs being
  regenerated. Conjugation occurs also, the two organisms fusing by their oral region; the
  locomotive organs and pharynx disappear; the conjoined cytoplasms unite to form a sphere, and the
  nuclei fuse to form a zygote or fertilisation nucleus. This conjugation is followed by sporulation
  or brood-formation.<a id="NtA_146" href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page134"><span class="smaller">{134}</span></span></div>

  <p>The nucleus passes towards the surface, undergoes successive fissions, and as division goes on
  the numerous daughter-nuclei occupy little prominences formed by the upgrowth of the cytoplasm of
  the upper pole. The rest of the cytoplasm atrophies, and the hillocks formed by the plasmic
  outgrowths around the final daughter-nuclei become separate as so many zoospores (usually 256 or
  512); each of these is oblong with a dorsal cap-like swelling, from the edge of which arises a
  flagellum pointing backwards; parallel to this the cap is prolonged on one side into a style also
  extending beyond the opposite pole of the animal.<a id="NtA_147"
  href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> In this state the zoospore is, to all outward view, a naked
  Dinoflagellate, whence it seems that the Cystoflagellates are to be regarded as closely allied to
  that group. <i>Leptodiscus</i> is concavo-convex, circular, with the mouth central on the convex
  face, 1-flagellate, and attains the enormous size of 1.5 mm. (<span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span>") in diameter.</p>

  <p>The remarkable phosphorescence of <i>Noctiluca</i> is not constant. It glows with a bluish or
  greenish light on any agitation, but rarely when undisturbed. A persistent stimulus causes a
  continuous, but weak, light. This light is so weak that several teaspoonsful of the organism,
  collected on a filter and spread out, barely enable one to read the figures on a watch a foot
  away. As in other marine phosphorescence, no rise of temperature can be detected. The luminosity
  resides in minute points, mostly crowded in the central mass, but scattered all through the
  cytoplasm. A slight irritation only produces luminosity at the point touched, a strong one causes
  the whole to flash. Any form of irritation, whether of heat, touch, or agitation, electricity or
  magnetism, is stated to induce the glow. By day, it is said, <i>Noctiluca</i>, when present in
  abundance, may give the sea the appearance of tomato soup.</p>

  <p>The earliest account of Noctiluca will be read with interest. Henry Baker writes in
  <i>Employment for the Microscope</i>:<a id="NtA_148" href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a>&mdash;"A
  curious Enquirer into Nature, dwelling at Wells upon the Coast of Norfolk, affirms from his own
  Observations that the Sparkling of Sea Water is occasioned by Insects. His Answer to a Letter
  wrote to him on that Subject runs thus, 'In the Glass of Sea Water I send with this are some of
  the Animalcules which cause the Sparkling Light in Sea Water; they may be seen by holding <span
  class="pagenum" id="page135"><span class="smaller">{135}</span></span>the Phial up against the
  Light, resembling very small Bladders or Air Bubbles, and are in all Places of it from Top to
  Bottom, but mostly towards the Top, where they assemble when the Water has stood still some Time,
  unless they have been killed by keeping them too long in the Phial. Placing one of these
  Animalcules before a good Microscope, an exceeding minute Worm may be discovered, hanging with its
  Tail fixed to an opake Spot in a Kind of Bladder, which it has certainly a Power of contracting or
  distending, and thereby of being suspended at the Surface, or at any Depth it pleases in the
  including Water.'"</p>

  <p>"The above-mentioned Phial of Sea Water came safe, and some of the Animalcules were discovered
  in it, but they did not emit any Light, as my Friend says they do, upon the least Motion of the
  Phial when the Water is newly taken up. He likewise adds, that at certain Times, if a Stone be
  thrown into the Sea, near the Shore, the Water will become luminous as far as the Motion reacheth:
  this chiefly happens when the Sea hath been greatly agitated, or after a Storm." Obviously what
  Mr. Sparshall, Baker's correspondent, took for a worm was the large flagellum.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The chief investigators of this group have been Huxley, Cienkowski, Allman,
  B&uuml;tschli, and G. Pouchet, while Ischikawa and Doflein have elucidated the conjugation.</p>

  <p>The Ciliata have so complex an organisation that, as with the Metazoa, it is well to begin with
  the description of a definite type. For this purpose we select <i>Stylonychia mytilus</i>, Ehrb.
  (Fig. 49), a species common in water rich in organic matter, and relatively large (<span
  class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">75</span>" = &#x2153; mm.). It is broadly oval in
  outline, with the wide end anterior, truncate, and sloping to the left side behind; the back is
  convex, thinning greatly in front; the belly flat. It moves through the water either by continuous
  swimming or by jerks, and can either crawl steadily over the surface of a solid or an air surface
  such as an air bubble, or advance by springs, which recall those of a hunting spider. The boundary
  is everywhere a thin plasmic pellicle, very tender, and readily undergoing diffluence like the
  rest of the cell. From the pellicle pass the cilia, which are organically connected with it,
  though they may be traced a little deeper; they are arranged in slanting longitudinal rows, and
  are much and variously modified, according to their place and function. On the edge of the dorsal
  surface they are fine and motionless, probably only sensory (<i>s.h.</i>); except three, which
  protrude well over the hinder end (<i>c.p.</i>), stout, pointed, and frayed out at the ends, and
  possibly serving as oars or rudders for the darting movements. These are distinguished from simple
  cilia as "cirrhi."</p>

  <p>At the right hand of the frontal area there begins, just within the dorsal edge, a row of
  strong cilium-like organs (Fig. 49, <i>per</i>); these, on careful examination, prove to be
  transverse triangular plates, which after death may fray into cilia.<a id="NtA_154"
  href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> They are the "adoral membranellae." This row passes to the
  left blunt angle, and there crosses over the edge of the body to the ventral aspect, and then
  curves inwards towards the median line, which it reaches about half-way back, where it passes into
  the pharynx (<i>m</i>). It forms the front and left-hand boundary of a wedge-shaped depression,
  the "peristomial area," the right-hand boundary being the "preoral ridge" or lip (<i>l</i>), which
  runs nearly on the median line, projecting downward and over the depression. This ridge bears on
  its inner and upper side a row of fine "preoral cilia" (<i>poc</i>) and a wide "preoral undulating
  membrane" (<i>p.om</i>), which extends horizontally across, below the peristomial area. The roof
  of this area bears along its right-hand edge an "internal undulating membrane" (<i>g</i>), and
  then, as we pass across to the left, first an "endoral membrane" and then an "endoral" row of
  cilia. In some allied genera (not in <i>Stylonychia</i>), at the base and on the inner side of
  each adoral membranella, is a "paroral" cilium. <span class="pagenum" id="page140"><span
  class="smaller">{140}</span></span>All these motile organs, with the exception of the preoral
  cilia, pass into the pharynx; but the adoral membranellae soon stop short for want of room. There
  are some seventy membranellae in the adoral wreath.</p>

  <p>The rest of the ventral surface is marked by longitudinal lines, along which the remaining
  appendages are disposed. On either side is a row of "marginal cirrhi" (<i>mc.</i>), which, like
  the membranellae, may fray out into cilia, but are habitually stiff spine-like, and straight in
  these rows; these are the chief swimming organs. Other cirrhi, also arranged along longitudinal
  rows, with so many blank spaces that the arrangement has to be carefully looked for, occur in
  groups along the ventral surface. On the right of the peristome are a group which are all
  curved&mdash;the "frontal cirrhi" (<i>f.c.</i>). Behind the mouth is a second group&mdash;the
  "abdominal cirrhi" (<i>a.c.</i>), also curved hooks; and behind these again the straight
  spine-like "caudal" or "anal" cirrhi (<i>c.c</i>), which point backwards. These three sets of
  ventral cirrhi are the organs by which the animal executes its crawling and darting movements.
  Besides the mouth there are two other openings, both indistinguishable save at the very moment of
  discharge; the anus (<i>an</i>) which is dorsal, and the pore of the contractile vacuole, which is
  ventral.</p>

  <p>The protoplasm of the body is sharply marked off into a soft, semi-fluid "endoplasm" or
  "endosarc," and a firmer "ectoplasm" or "ectosarc." The former is rich in granules of various
  kinds, and in food-vacuoles wherein the food is digested. The mode of ingestion, etc., is
  described below (p. <a href="#page145">145</a>). The ectoplasm is honeycombed with alveoli of
  definite arrangement, the majority being radial to the surface or elongated channels running
  lengthwise; inside each of these lies a contractile plasmic streak or myoneme. The contractile
  vacuole (<i>cv</i>) lies in this layer, a little behind the mouth, and is in connexion with two
  canals, an anterior (<i>e</i>) and a posterior, from which it is replenished.</p>

  <p>The nuclear apparatus lies on the inner boundary of the ectoplasm; it consists of (1) a large
  "meganucleus" formed of two ovoid lobes (<i>N</i>, <i>N</i>), united by a slender thread; and (2)
  two minute "micronuclei" (<i>n</i>, <i>n</i>), one against either lobe of the meganucleus.</p>

  <p><i>Stylonychia</i> multiplies by transverse fission, the details of which are considered on pp.
  <a href="#page144">144</a>, <a href="#page147">147</a>.</p>

  <p>The protoplasm of Ciliata is the most differentiated that we <span class="pagenum"
  id="page141"><span class="smaller">{141}</span></span>find in the Protista, and we can speak
  without exaggeration of the "organs" formed thereby.</p>

  <p>The form of the body, determined by the firm <b>pellicle</b> or plasmic membrane, is fairly
  constant for each species, though it may be subject to temporary flexures and contractions. The
  pellicle varies in rigidity; where the cilia are abundant it is proportionately delicate, and
  scarcely differs from the ectoplasm proper, save for not being alveolate. In the Peritrichaceae it
  is especially resistant and proof against decay. In <i>Coleps</i> (Gymnostomaceae) it is hardened
  and sculptured into the semblance of plate-armour, and the prominent points of the plates around
  the mouth serve as teeth to lacerate other active Protista, its prey; but, like the rest of the
  protoplasm, this disappears by decay soon after the death of the <i>Coleps</i>. Where, as in
  certain Oligotrichaceae, cilia are absent over part of the body, the pellicle is hardened; and on
  the dorsal face and sides of <i>Dysteria</i> it even assumes the character of a bivalve shell, and
  forms a tooth-like armature about the mouth.</p>

  <p>From the pellicle protrude the <b>cilia</b>, each of which is continued inwards by a slender
  basal filament to end in a "basal granule" or "blepharoplast." The body-cilia are fine, and often
  reversible in action, which is exceptional in the organic world. They may be modified or combined
  in various ways. We have seen that in <i>Stylonychia</i> some are motionless sensory hairs. The
  cirrhi and setae sometimes fray out during life, and often after death, into a brush at the tip,
  and have a number of blepharoplasts at their base. The same holds good for the membranellae and
  undulating membranes. They are thus comparable to the "vibratile styles" of Rotifers (Vol. II. p.
  202) and the "combs" or "Ctenophoral plates" of the Ctenophora (p. <a href="#page412">412</a>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <b>ectosarc</b> has a very complex structure.  Like other protoplasm it has a honeycombed
  or alveolate structure, but in this case the alveoli are permanent in their arrangement and
  position. Rows of these alveoli run under the surface; and the cilia are given off from their
  nodal points where the vertical walls of several unite, and wherein the basal granule or
  blepharoplast is contained. Longitudinal threads running along the inner walls of the alveoli of
  the superficial layer are differentiated into muscular fibrils or "myonemes," to which structures
  so many owe their marked longitudinal striation on the one hand, and their power of sudden
  contraction on the other. The appearance of transverse striation may be either due to transverse
  myonemes, or produced by the folds into which the contraction of longitudinal fibrils habitually
  wrinkles the pellicles, when it is fairly dense (Peritrichaceae); circular muscular fibrils,
  however, undoubtedly exist in the peristomial collar of this group. Embedded in the ectosarc are
  often found <b>trichocysts</b>,<a id="NtA_156" href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> analogous <span
  class="pagenum" id="page143"><span class="smaller">{143}</span></span>to the nematocysts of the
  Coelenterata (p. <a href="#page247">247</a>), and doubtless fulfilling a similar purpose,
  offensive and defensive. A trichocyst is an oblong sac (<span class="wnw">4 &micro;</span> long in
  <i>Paramecium</i>) at right angles to the surface, which on irritation, chemical (by tannin,
  acids, etc.) or mechanical, emits or is converted into a thread several times the length of the
  cilia (<span class="wnw">33 &micro;</span>), often barbed at the tip. In the predaceous Gymnostomaceae,
  such as <i>Didinium</i>, the trichocysts around (or even within) the mouth are of exceptional
  size, and are ejected to paralyse, and ultimately to kill, the active Infusoria on which they
  feed. In most of the Peritrichaceae they are, when present, limited to the rim around the
  peristome, while in the majority of species of Ciliata they have not been described. Fibrils,
  possibly nervous,<a id="NtA_157" href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> have been described in the
  deepest layer of the ectosarc in Heterotrichaceae.</p>

  <p>The innermost layer of the ectosarc is often channelled by a system of canals,<a id="NtA_158"
  href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> usually inconspicuous, as they discharge continuously into the
  <b>contractile vacuole</b>; but by inducing partial asphyxia (<i>e.g.</i> by not renewing the
  limited supply of air dissolved in the drop of water on the slide under the cover-glass), the
  action of the vacuole is slackened, and these canals may be more readily demonstrated. The
  vacuole, after disappearance, forms anew either by the coalescence of minute formative vacuoles,
  or by the enlargement of the severed end of the canal or canals. The pore of discharge to the
  surface is visible in several species, even in the intervals of contraction.<a id="NtA_159"
  href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> The pore is sometimes near that of the anus, but is only
  associated with it in Peritrichaceae, where it opens beside it into the vestibule or first part of
  the long pharynx, often through a rounded reservoir (Fig. 60, <i>r</i>) or elongated canal.</p>

  <p>The <b>endosarc</b>, in most Ciliates well differentiated from the ectosarc, is very soft;
  though it is not in constant rotation like that of a Rhizopod, it is the seat of circulatory
  movements alternating with long periods of rest. Thus it is that the food-vacuoles, after
  describing a more or less erratic course, come to discharge their undigested products at the one
  point, the <b>anus</b>. <span class="pagenum" id="page144"><span
  class="smaller">{144}</span></span>In a few genera (<i>Didinium</i>, for instance) the course from
  mouth to anus is a direct straight line, and one may almost speak of a digestive tract. In
  <i>Loxodes</i> and <i>Trachelius</i> (Fig. 56) the endosarc, as in the Flagellate <i>Noctiluca</i>
  (Fig. 48, p. <a href="#page133">133</a>), has a central mass into which the food is taken, and
  which sends out lobes, which branch as they approach and join the ectoplasm. The endosarc contains
  excretory granules, probably calcium phosphate, droplets of oil or dissolved glycogen, proteid
  spherules, paraglycogen grains, etc.</p>

  <p>The <b>nuclear apparatus</b> lies at the inner boundary of the ectoplasm. The "meganucleus" may
  be ovoid, elongated, or composed of two or more rounded lobes connected by slender bridges
  (<i>Stentor</i>, <i>Stylonychia</i>). The "micronucleus" may be single; but even when the
  meganucleus is not lobed it may be accompanied by more than one micronucleus, and when it is lobed
  there is at least one micronucleus to each of its lobes.<a id="NtA_160"
  href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> The meganucleus often presents distinct granules of more
  deeply staining material, varying with the state of nutrition; these are especially visible in the
  band-like meganuclei of the Peritrichaceae (Figs. 51, 60). At the approach of fission it is in
  many cases distinctly fibrillated.<a id="NtA_161" href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> But all
  other internal differentiation, as well as any constriction, then disappears; and the ovoid or
  rounded figure becomes elongated and hour-glass shaped, and finally constricts into two ovoid
  daughter-meganuclei, which, during and after the fission of the cell, gradually assume the form
  characteristic of the species. The micronuclei (each and all when they are multiple) divide by
  modification of karyokinesis (or "mitosis") as a prelude to fission: in this process the chromatin
  is resolved into threads which divide longitudinally, but the nuclear wall <span class="pagenum"
  id="page145"><span class="smaller">{145}</span></span>remains intact. If an Infusorian be divided
  into small parts, only such as possess a micronucleus and a fragment of the meganucleus are
  capable of survival. We shall see how important a part the micronuclei play in conjugation, a
  process in which the old meganuclei are completely disorganised and broken up and their d&eacute;bris
  expelled or digested.</p>

  <p>The <b>mouth</b> of the Gymnostomaceae is habitually closed, opening only for the ingestion of
  the living Protista that form their prey. It usually opens into a funnel-shaped <b>pharynx</b>,
  strengthened with a circle of firm longitudinal bars, recalling the mouth of an eel-trap or
  lobster-pot ("Reusenapparat" of the Germans); and this is sometimes protrusible. In
  <i>Dysteria</i> the rods are replaced by a complicated arrangement of jaw- or tooth-like
  thickenings, which are not yet adequately described. We have above noted the strong adoral
  trichocysts in this group.</p>

  <p>In all other Ciliates<a id="NtA_162" href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> the "mouth" is a
  permanent depression lined by a prolongation of the pellicle, and containing cilia and one or more
  undulating membranes, and when adoral membranellae are present, a continuation of these. In some
  species, such as <i>Pleuronema</i> (Fig. 57), one or two large membranes border the mouth right
  and left. In Peritrichaceae the first part of the pharynx is distinguished as the "vestibule,"
  since it receives the openings of the contractile vacuole or its reservoir and the anus. The
  pharynx at its lower end (after a course exceptionally long and devious in the Peritrichaceae;
  Figs. 51, 60) ends against the soft endosarc, where the food-particles accumulate into a rounded
  pellet; this grows by accretion of fresh material until it passes into the endosarc, which closes
  up behind it with a sort of lurch. Around the pellet liquid is secreted to form the food-vacuole.
  If the material supplied be coloured and insoluble, like indigo or carmine, the vacuoles may be
  traced in a sort of irregular, discontinuous circulation through the endosarc until their remains
  are finally discharged as faeces through the anus. No prettier sight can be watched under the
  microscope than that of a colony of the social Bell-animalcule (<i>Carchesium</i>) in coloured
  water&mdash;all producing food-currents brilliantly shown up by the wild eddies of the pigment
  granules, and the vivid blue or crimson colour of <span class="pagenum" id="page146"><span
  class="smaller">{146}</span></span>the food-vacuoles, the whole combining to present a most
  attractive picture. Ehrenberg fancied that a continuous tube joined up the vacuoles, and
  interpreted them as so many stomachs threaded, as it were, along a slender gut; whence he named
  the group "Polygastrica."</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 51.</span>&mdash;<i>Carchesium polypinum.</i> Scheme of
      the path taken by the ingested food in digestion and expulsion of the excreta. The food enters
      through the pharynx and is transported downward (small circles), where it is stored in the
      concavity of the sausage-shaped meganucleus (the latter is recognised by its containing darker
      bodies). It remains here for some time at rest (small crosses). Then it passes upward upon the
      other side (dots) and returns to the middle of the cell, where it undergoes solution. The
      excreta are removed to the outside, through the vestibule and cell mouth. The black line with
      arrows indicates the direction of the path. (From Verworn, after Greenwood.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>We owe to Miss Greenwood<a id="NtA_163" href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> a full account of
  the formation and changes of the food-vacuoles in <i>Carchesium polypinum</i>. The vacuole passes
  steadily along the endosarc for a certain time after its sudden admission into it, and then enters
  on a phase of quiescence. A little later the contents of the vacuole aggregate together in the
  centre of the vacuole, where they are surrounded by a zone of clear liquid; this takes place in
  the hollow of the meganucleus, in this species horseshoe-shaped. The vacuole then slowly passes on
  towards the peristome, lying deep in the endosarc, and the fluid peripheral zone is absorbed.
  <span class="pagenum" id="page147"><span class="smaller">{147}</span></span>For some time no
  change is shown in the food-material itself: this is the stage of "storage." Eventually a fresh
  zone of liquid, the true digestive vacuole, forms again round the food-pellet, and this contains a
  peptic juice, of acid reaction. The contents, so far as they are capable of being digested,
  liquefy and disappear. Ultimately the solid particles in their vacuole reach the anal area of the
  vestibule, and pass into it, to be swept away by the overflow of the food-current. The anus is
  seated on a transverse ridge about a third down the tube, the remaining two-thirds being the true
  pharynx.</p>

  <p><b>Fission</b> is usually transverse; but is oblique in the conical Heterotrichaceae, and
  longitudinal in the Peritrichaceae. It involves the peristome, of which one of the two sisters
  receives the greater, the other the lesser part; each regenerates what is missing. When there are
  two contractile vacuoles, as in <i>Paramecium</i>, either sister receives one, and has to form
  another; where there is a canal or reservoir divided at fission, an extension of this serves to
  give rise to a new vacuole in that sister which does not retain the old one. In some cases the
  fission is so unequal as to have the character of budding (<i>Spirochona</i>). We have described
  above (p. <a href="#page144">144</a>) the relations of the nuclear apparatus in fission.</p>

  <p>Several of the Ciliata divide only when encysted, and then the divisions are in close
  succession, forming a brood of four, rarely more. This is well seen in the common <i>Colpoda
  cucullus</i>. In the majority, however, <b>encystment</b> is resorted to only as a means of
  protection against drought, etc., or for quiet rest after a full meal (<i>Lacrymaria</i>).</p>

  <p>Maupas<a id="NtA_164" href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> has made a very full study of the
  <b>life-cycles</b> of the Ciliata. He cultivated them under the usual conditions for microscopic
  study, <i>i.e.</i> on a slide under a thin glass cover supported by bristles to avoid pressure,
  preserved in a special moist chamber; and examined them at regular intervals.</p>

  <p>The animals collect at that zone where the conditions of aeration are most suitable, usually
  just within the edge of the cover, and when well supplied with food are rather sluggish, not
  swimming far, so that they are easily studied and counted. When well supplied with appropriate
  food they undergo binary fission at frequent intervals, dividing as often as five times in the
  twenty-four hours at a temperature of 65-69&deg; F. (<i>Glaucoma scintillans)</i>, so that in this
  period a single individual has resolved itself into a posterity of 32; but such a rapid increase
  is exceptional. At a minimum and a maximum temperature multiplication is arrested, the optimum
  lying midway. If the food-supply is cut off, encystment occurs in those species capable of the
  process; but when there is a mixture of members of different broods of the same species, subject
  to the limitations that we shall learn, conjugation ensues. Under the conditions of Maupas'
  investigations he found a limit to the possibilities of continuous fissions, even when interrupted
  by occasional encystment. The individuals of a series ultimately dwindle in size, their ciliary
  apparatus is reduced, and their nuclear apparatus degenerates. Thus the ultimate members of a
  fission-cycle show a progressive decay, notably in the nuclear apparatus, which Maupas has aptly
  compared to "senility" or "old age" in the Metazoan. If by the <i>timely</i> mixture of broods
  conjugation be induced, these senile degenerations do not occur.<a id="NtA_165"

  approach, lying parallel and with their oral faces or their sides (<i>Stentor</i>) together, and

  this last division one remains where it is as a "stationary" pairing nucleus, while its sister
  passes as a "migratory" pairing-nucleus into the other mate, and fuses with its stationary
  pairing-nucleus. Thus in either mate is formed a "zygote-nucleus," or "fusion-nucleus." All these
  processes are simultaneous in the two mates; and the migratory nuclei cross one another on the
  bridge of junction of the two mates (Fig. 52, C). Each mate now has its original cytoplasm
  (subject to the qualification above), <span class="pagenum" id="page151"><span
  class="smaller">{151}</span></span>but its old nuclear apparatus is replaced by the
  fusion-nucleus. This new nucleus undergoes repeated fissions; its offspring enlarge unequally, the
  larger being differentiated as mega-, the smaller as micro-nuclei. The mates now separate (Fig.
  52, F, G), and by the first (or subsequent) fission of each, the new mega- and micro-nuclei are
  distributed to the offspring. <i>Colpidium colpoda</i> offers the simplest case, on which we have
  founded our diagram showing the nuclear relations. During conjugation the oral apparatus often
  atrophies, and is regenerated; and in some cases the pellicle and ciliary apparatus are also "made
  over."</p>

  <p>In the Peritrichaceae the mates are unequal; the larger is the normal cell, and is fixed; the
  smaller, mobile, is derived from an ordinary individual by brood-divisions, which only occur under
  the conditions that induce conjugation (Fig. 60). Here, though the two pairs of nuclei are formed,
  it is only the migratory <span class="pagenum" id="page152"><span
  class="smaller">{152}</span></span>nuclei that unite, the stationary ones aborting in both mates.
  During the final processes of conjugation the smaller mate is absorbed into the body of the
  larger, and so plays the part of male there. But this process, though one of true binary sex, is
  clearly derived from the peculiar type of equal reciprocal conjugation of the other Infusoria.</p>

  <p>The Ciliata are almost all free-swimming animals with the exception of most of the
  Peritrichaceae, and of the genera we now cite. <i>Folliculina</i> forms a sessile tube open at
  either end; and <i>Schizotricha socialis</i> inhabits the open mouths of a branching gelatinous
  tubular stem, obviously secreted by the hinder end of the animal, and forking at each fission to
  receive the produce. A similar habit to the latter characterises <i>Maryna socialis</i>; all three
  species are marine, and were described by Gruber.<a id="NtA_168"
  href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> <i>Stentor</i> habitually attaches itself by processes
  recalling pseudopodia, and often forms a gelatinous sheath.</p>

  <p>The majority of the Oligotrichaceous Tintinnidae inhabit free chitinous tests often beautifully
  fenestrated, as in <i>Dictyocystis</i>.</p>

  <p>Many genera are parasitic in the alimentary canal of various Metazoa, but none appear to be
  seriously harmful except <i>Ichthyophtheirius</i>, which causes an epidemic in fresh-water fish.
  Quite a peculiar fauna inhabit the paunch of Ruminants. <i>Nyctotherus</i> and <i>Balantidium</i>
  are occasionally found in the alimentary canal of Man.<a id="NtA_169"
  href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Gymnostomaceae are predaceous, feeding for the most part on smaller Ciliates. We have
  described the peculiar character of the mouth and pharynx in this group, and the mail-like
  pellicle of <i>Coleps</i> (Fig. 54). <i>Loxophyllum</i> is remarkable for the absence of cilia
  from one of the sides of its flattened body, and the tufts of trichocysts studding its dorsal edge
  at regular intervals. <i>Actinobolus</i> has numerous tentacles, exsertile and retractile, each
  bearing a terminal tuft of trichocysts, which serve to paralyse such active prey as
  <i>Halteria</i>. <i>Ileonema</i> has one tentacle overhanging the mouth; and <i>Mesodinium</i> has
  four short sucker-like projections around it.<a id="NtA_170" href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a>
  It has only two girdles <span class="pagenum" id="page153"><span
  class="smaller">{153}</span></span>of cilia, which are stout and resemble fine-pointed cirrhi. In
  <i>Dysteria</i> the cilia are exclusively ventral, and the naked dorsal surface has its pellicle
  condensed into a bivalve shell; a posterior motile process ("foot") and a complex pharyngeal
  armature add to the exceptional characters of the genus.</p>

  <p>The Aspirotrichaceae are well known to every student of "Elementary Biology" by the "type"
  <i>Paramecium</i> (Fig. 55), so common in infusions, especially when containing a little animal
  matter. <i>P. bursaria</i> often contains in its endosarc the green symbiotic Flagellate
  <i>Zoochlorella</i>. <i>Colpoda cucullus</i>, very frequent in vegetable infusions, usually only
  divides during encystment, and forms a brood of four. <i>Pleuronema chrysalis</i> (Fig. 57) is
  remarkable for its habit of lying for long periods on its side and for its immense undulating
  membrane, forming a lip on the left of its mouth; <i>Glaucoma</i> has two, right and left.</p>

  <p>The Heterotrichaceae present very remarkable forms. <i>Spirostomum</i> is nearly cylindrical,
  and, a very giant, may attain a length of 4 mm. (<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span
  class="suu">6</span>"). <i>Stentor</i> can attach itself by its hinder end, which is then finely
  tapered and prolonged into a few pseudopodia; its body is trumpet-shaped, with a spiral peristome
  forming a coil round its wide end, and leading on the left side into the mouth. Many species when
  attached secrete a gelatinous sheath or tube. <i>S. polymorphus</i> is often coloured green by
  <i>Zoochlorella</i> (p. <a href="#page125">125</a>); <i>S. coeruleus</i><a id="NtA_171"
  href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> and <i>S. igneus</i> owe their names to the brilliant pigment,
  blue or scarlet, deposited in granules in lines between the conspicuous longitudinal myonemes.
  From their large size and elongated meganucleus accompanied by numerous micronuclei, these two
  genera have frequently been utilised for experiments on regeneration. In <i>Metopus sigmoides</i>
  the peristomial area forms a dome above its wreath of membranellae; and in <i>M. pyriformis</i>
  this is so great as to form the larger part of the cell, which is top-shaped, tapering behind to a
  point. <i>Caenomorpha</i> (Fig. 58) has the same general form, with a peg-like tail, and possesses
  a girdle of cirrhi.<a id="NtA_172" href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> The converse occurs in
  <span class="pagenum" id="page155"><span class="smaller">{155}</span></span><i>Bursaria</i>; the
  cell is a half ellipse, something like a common twin tobacco-pouch when closed: a deep depression
  thus occupies the whole ventral surface, and opens by a wide slit extending along the anterior
  end. The peristomial area occupies the dorsal side of the pocket so formed, and the mouth is in
  the hinder left-hand corner. <i>Blepharisma</i> sp. is parasitic in the Heliozoon <i>Raphidiophrys
  viridis</i> (Fig. 20, <span class="smaller">1</span>, p. <a href="#page74">74</a>).</p>

  <p>Among Peritrichaceae, <i>Vorticella</i> (Fig. 60) and its allies have long been known as
  Bell-animalcules to every student of pond-life. The body has indeed the form of an inverted bell,
  closed at its mouth by the "peristome," or oral disc; this is a short, inverted truncate cone set
  obliquely so that its wide base hardly projects at one side, but is tilted high on the other; the
  edge of the bell is turned out into a rim or "collar," separated from the disc by a deep gutter.
  The collar, habitually everted, or even turned down, contracts over the retracted disc when the
  animal is retracted (E<sup>2</sup>), which is brought about by any sort of shock, or when it swims
  freely backwards. For the latter purpose a posterior ring of cilia (or rather membranellae) is
  developed round the hinder end of the bell (A, <i>cr</i>, E<sup>3</sup>). The cilia of the adoral
  wreath are very strong, united at the base into a continuous membrane, and indeed themselves
  partake of the composite nature of membranellae. The wreath forms more than one turn of a
  right-handed spiral, the innermost turn ending abruptly on the disc, the outer leading down into
  the mouth at the point where the disc is most tilted and the groove deepest.<a id="NtA_174"
  href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> The pharynx (<i>p</i>) is long, and contains an undulating
  membrane (<i>u.m</i>) on its inner side projecting out through the mouth, and numerous cilia; it
  leads deep into the body (<i>p</i>). The first part is distinguished as the "vestibule"
  (<i>v</i>), as into it opens the anus, and the contractile vacuole (<i>c.v.</i>), the latter
  sometimes opening by a reservoir (<i>r</i>). The body contains in the ectoplasm <span
  class="pagenum" id="page157"><span class="smaller">{157}</span></span>myonema-fibrils which, by
  their contraction, withdraw the disc, and at the same time circular fibrils close the peristome
  over it. In the type-genus the pellicle is continued into a long, slender elastic stalk
  (<i>s</i>), of which the longitudinal myoneme fibrils of the ectoplasm converge to the stalk, and
  are prolonged into it as a spirally winding fibre, sometimes transversely striated.<a id="NtA_175"
  href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> The effect of the contraction of this is to pull the stalk
  into a helicoid spiral (like a coil-spring), with the line of insertion of the muscle along the
  inner side of the coils, which is, of course, the shortest path from one end to the other (Fig.
  60, B).</p>

  <p>The members of the Vorticellidae are very commonly attached to weeds or to various aquatic
  Metazoa, each species being more or less restricted in its haunts. <i>Vorticella</i>, the type, is
  singly <span class="pagenum" id="page158"><span class="smaller">{158}</span></span>attached to a
  contractile stalk; fission takes place in the vertical plane, and one of the two so formed retains
  the original stalk, while the other swims off (Fig. 60, E<sup>1</sup>-E<sup>3</sup>), often to
  settle close by, so that the individuals are found in large social aggregates, side by side,
  fringing water-weeds with a halo visible to the naked eye, which disappears on agitation by the
  sudden contraction of all the stalks. <i>Carchesium</i> and <i>Zoothamnium</i> differ from
  <i>Vorticella</i> in the fact that the one daughter-cell remains attached by a stalk coming off a
  little below the body of the other, so as to give rise to large branching colonies.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In <i>Carchesium</i> (Fig. 51) the muscular threads of each cell are separate,
  while in <i>Zoothamnium</i> they are continuous throughout the colony. <i>Epistylis</i> has a
  solid, rigid stalk, and may give rise to branching colonies, which often infest the body of the
  Water-Fleas (Copepoda) of the genus <i>Cyclops</i>. <i>Opercularia</i> is characterised by the
  depth of the gutter, the height of the collar, and the tapering downward of the elongated disc.
  <i>Vaginicola</i>, <i>Pyxicola</i>, <i>Cothurnia</i>, <i>Scyphidia</i>, all inhabit tubes, some of
  extreme elegance. <i>Ophrydium</i> is a colonial form, found in ponds and ditches, resembling
  <i>Opercularia</i>, but inhabiting tubes of jelly<a id="NtA_176"
  href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> that coalesce by their outer walls into a large floating
  sphere; it usually contains the green symbiotic Flagellate <i>Zoochlorella</i>. <i>Trichodina</i>
  is free, short, and cylindrical, with both wreaths permanently exposed, and is provided with a
  circlet of hooks within the aboral wreath. It is often parasitic, or perhaps rather epizoic, on
  the surface of <i>Hydra</i> (see p. <a href="#page254">254</a>), gliding over its body<a
  id="NtA_177" href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> with a graceful waltzing movement; it occurs also

  <p>This group, despite a superficial resemblance to the Heliozoa, show a close affinity to the
  Ciliata; the nuclear apparatus is usually double though a micronucleus is not always seen; the
  young are always ciliated, and the mode of conjugation is identical in all cases hitherto studied.
  Most of the genera are attached by a chitinous stalk (Fig. 61), continued in <i>Acineta</i> into a
  cup or "theca" surrounding the cell. The pellicle is firm, often minutely shagreened or "milled"
  in optical section by fine radial processes, whether superficial rods or the expression of the
  meeting edges of radial alveoli is as yet uncertain. The pellicle closely invests the ectosarc, is
  continued down into a tubular sheath, from the base of which the tentacle rises, and upwards to
  invest the tentacle, and is even prolonged into its cavity in <i>Choanophrya</i>, the only genus
  where the tentacles are large enough for satisfactory demonstration. These organs may be one or
  more, and vary greatly in character. They may be (1) pointed for prehension, puncture, and suction
  (<i>Ephelota</i>, Fig. 61, <span class="smaller">5</span>); (2) nearly cylindrical, with a
  slightly "flared" truncate apex (<i>Podophrya</i>, Fig. 61, <span
  class="smaller">1<i>a</i></span>); (3) filiform with a terminal knob; (4) "capitate"
  (<i>Acineta</i>, Fig. 61, <span class="smaller">2</span>); (5) bluntly truncate and capable of
  opening into a wide funnel for the suction of food<a id="NtA_179"
  href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a> (<i>Choanophrya</i>, Fig. 62; <i>Rhyncheta</i>, Fig. 61, <span
  class="smaller">3</span>). Their movements, too, are varied, including retraction and protrusion,
  and a degree of flexion which reaches a maximum in <i>Rhyncheta</i> (Fig. 61, <span
  class="smaller">3</span>), whose tentacle is as freely motile as an elephant's trunk might be
  supposed to be were it as slender in proportion to its length. They are continued into the body,
  and in <i>Choanophrya</i> may extend right across it. In <i>Podophrya</i> trold the pellicle rises
  into a conical tube about the base of the tentacle, which is retracted through it completely with
  the prey in deglutition. In <i>Dendrocometes</i>, <i>Dendrosoma</i>, and <i>Ophryodendron</i>
  (Fig. 61, <span class="smaller">4</span>, <span class="smaller">9</span>, <span

  <p>The mechanism of suction is doubtful; but from the way particles from a little distance flow
  into the open funnels of <i>Choanophrya</i>, it may be the result of an increase of osmotic
  pressure. The external pellicle of the tentacles is marked by a spiral constriction,<a
  id="NtA_180" href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> which may be prolonged over the part included in
  the sheath. The endosarc is rich in oil-drops, often coloured, and in proteid granules which
  sometimes absorb stains so readily as to have been named "tinctin bodies." It usually contains at
  least one contractile vacuole.</p>

  <p>In <i>Dendrocometes</i> (and perhaps others) the whole cell may become ciliated, detach itself
  and swim off; this it does when its host (<i>Gammarus</i>) moults its cuticle.</p>

  <p>In fission or budding we have to distinguish many modes. (1) In the simplest, after the nuclear
  apparatus has divided, the cell divides transversely; the distal half acquires cilia and swims off
  to attach itself elsewhere, while the proximal remains attached. The tentacles have previously
  disappeared and have to be formed afresh in both. (2) More commonly fission passes into budding on
  the distal face; a sort of groove deepens around a central prominence which becomes the ciliated
  larva (Fig. 62, <i>em</i>); the tentacles of the "parent" are retained. This process passes into
  (3) "internal budding," where a minute pit leads into a bottle-shaped cavity.<a id="NtA_181"
  href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> (4) Again, the budding may be multiple, the meganucleus
  protruding a branch for each bud, while the micronucleus, by successive divisions, affords the
  supply requisite. <i>Sphaerophrya</i> (Fig. 61, <span class="smaller">6</span>) and
  <i>Endosphaera</i> multiply freely by fission within their Ciliate hosts, and were indeed
  described by Stein as stages in their life-cycle. Conjugation of the same type as in most Ciliates
  has been fully worked out in <i>Dendrocometes</i> alone, by Hickson,<a id="NtA_182"

  FLUVIATILIS</i></span> FROM FRESH WATER&mdash;DEFINITION&mdash;POSITION IN THE ANIMAL
  KINGDOM.</span></p>

  <p>Sponges occupy, perhaps, a more isolated position than any other animal phylum. They are not
  only the lowest group of multicellular animals, but they are destitute of multicellular relatives.
  They are all aquatic and&mdash;with the exclusion of a few genera found in fresh
  water&mdash;marine, inhabiting all depths from between tide marks to the great abysses of the
  ocean. They depend for their existence on a current of water which is caused to circulate through
  their bodies by the activity of certain flagellated cells. This current contains their food, it is
  their means of respiration, and it carries away effete matters. Consequently sponges cannot endure
  deprivation of oxygenated water except for short periods, and only the hardiest inhabit regions
  where the supply is intermittent, as between tide marks. This also renders useless attempts to
  keep specimens in tanks, unless the water is frequently renewed.</p>

  <p>The outward appearance of sponges has an exceptionally wide range, so that it is difficult to
  give a novice any very definite picture of what he is to expect when searching for these animals.
  This diversity is in part due to the absence of organs of sufficient size to determine the shape
  of the whole or limit its variation, <span class="pagenum" id="page166"><span
  class="smaller">{166}</span></span>that is to say, the separate organs are of an order of size
  inferior to that of the entire body. The animals are fixed or lie loose on the sea bottom; there
  are in no case organs of locomotion, and again no sense-organs, no segregated organs of sex, and
  as a rule no distinction into axis and lateral members. It is by these negative characters that
  the collector may easily recognise a sponge.</p>

  <p><b>History.</b>&mdash;Sponges are, then, in many of their characters unique; and they present a
  variety of problems for solution, both of special and general interest, they are widely
  distributed in time and space, and they include a host of forms. It therefore causes no little
  surprise to learn that they have suffered from a long neglect, even their animal nature having
  been but recently established. Though known to naturalists from the time of Aristotle, sponges
  have been left for modern workers as a heritage of virgin soil: it has yielded to them a rich
  harvest, and is as yet far from exhausted.</p>

  <p>The familiar bath sponge was naturally the earliest known member of the phylum. It is dignified
  by mention in the <i>Iliad</i> and in the <i>Odyssey</i>, and Homer, in his choice of the
  adjective "full of holes," <span title="polytr&ecirc;tos"
  class="fsn">&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&#x03CD;&tau;&rho;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, shows at
  least as much observation as many a naturalist of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
  Aristotle based his ideas of sponges entirely upon the characters of the bath sponge and its near
  allies, for these were the only kinds he knew. With his usual perspicuity he reached the
  conclusion that sponges are animals, though showing points of likeness to plants.</p>

  <p>The accounts of sponges after Aristotle present little of scientific interest until the last
  century. Doubtless this is in part due to the absence of organs which would admit of dissection,
  and the consequent necessity of finer methods of study. Like other attached forms, sponges were
  plant or animal as it pleased the imagination of the writer, and sometimes they were "plant
  animals" or Zoophyta: those who thought them animal were frequently divided among themselves as to
  whether they were "polypous" or "apolypous." An opinion which it is somewhat difficult to classify
  was that of Dr. Nehemiah Grew,<a id="NtA_186" href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> who says: "No
  <i>Sponge</i> hath any Lignous Fibers, but is wholly composed of those which make the Pith and all
  the pithy parts <span class="pagenum" id="page167"><span class="smaller">{167}</span></span>of a
  Plant, ... So that a <i>Sponge</i>, instead of being a <i>Zoophyton</i>, is but the one-half of a
  Plant."</p>

  <p>Sponges figure in herbals beside seaweeds and mushrooms, and Gerarde says:<a id="NtA_187"
  href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> "There is found growing upon rockes near unto the sea a
  certaine matter wrought together of the foame or froth of the sea which we call Spunges ...
  whereof to speak at any length would little benefit the reader ... seeing the use thereof is so
  well known." About the middle of the eighteenth century, authors, especially Peyssonnel, suggested
  that sponges were but the houses of worms, which built them much as a bee or wasp builds nests and
  cells. This was confuted by Ellis in 1765,<a id="NtA_188" href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> when
  he pointed out that the sponge could not be a dead structure, as it gave proof of life by "sucking
  and throwing out water." To Ellis, then, is due the credit of first describing, though
  imperfectly, a current set up by sponges. He mentions that Count Marsigli<a id="NtA_189"
  href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> had already made somewhat similar observations.</p>

  <p>It was not till 1825 that attention was again turned to the current, when Robert Grant
  approached the group in a truly scientific manner, and was ably supported by Lieberk&uuml;hn. It would
  be impossible to do justice to Grant in the brief summary to which we must limit ourselves. The
  most important of his contributions was the discovery that water enters the sponge by small
  apertures scattered over the surface, and leaves it at certain larger holes, always pursuing a
  fixed course. He made a few rough experiments to estimate the approximate strength of the current,
  and, though he failed to detect its cause, he supposed that it was probably due to ciliary action.
  Grant's suggestion was afterwards substantiated by Dujardin (1838), Carter (1847), Dobie (1852),
  and Lieberk&uuml;hn (1857). These five succeeded in establishing the claims of sponges to a place in
  the animal kingdom, claims which were still further confirmed when James-Clark<a id="NtA_190"
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> detected the presence of the protoplasmic collar of the
  flagellated cells (see pp. <a href="#page171">171</a>, <a href="#page176">176</a>). Data were now
  wanted on which to base an opinion as to the position of sponges within the animal kingdom. In
  1878 Schulze<a id="NtA_191" href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> furnished valuable embryological
  facts, in a description agreeing with an earlier one of Metschnikoff's, of the amphiblastula larva
  (p. <a href="#page226">226</a>) and its metamorphosis. <span class="pagenum" id="page168"><span
  class="smaller">{168}</span></span>Then B&uuml;tschli<a id="NtA_192"
  href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> (1884) and Sollas<a id="NtA_193"
  href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> on combined morphological and embryological evidence (1884)
  concluded that sponges were remote from all the Metazoa, showing bonds only with Choanoflagellate
  Protozoa (p. <a href="#page121">121</a>). This the exact embryological work of Maas, Minchin, and
  Delage has done much to prove, but it has to be admitted that unanimity on the exact position of
  the phylum has not yet been attained, some authorities, such as Haeckel, Schulze, and Maas still
  wishing to include sponges in the Metazoa.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In this short history we have been obliged to refer only to work helping directly
  to solve the problem of the nature of a sponge, hence many names are absent which we should have
  wished to mention.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Halichondria panicea.</b></p>

  <p>One of the commonest of British sponges, which may be picked up on almost any of our beaches,
  and which has also a cosmopolitan distribution, is known by the clumsy popular name of the "crumb
  of bread sponge," alluding to its consistency; or by the above technical name, with which even
  more serious fault may be found.<a id="NtA_194" href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In its outward form <i>H. panicea</i> affords an excellent case of a peculiarity common among
  sponges. Its appearance varies according to the position in which it has lived. In fact, Bowerbank
  remarks that it has no specific form. It may grow in sheets of varying thickness closely attached
  to a rock, when it is "encrusting," or it is frequently massive and lying free on the sea bottom;
  again, it may be fistular, consisting of a single long tube, or it may be ridge-like, apparently
  in this case consisting of a row of long tubes fused laterally. In this last form it used to be
  called the "cockscomb sponge," having been taken for a distinct species.</p>

  <p>Bidder has proposed to call the different forms of the same species "metamps" of the species.
  Figures of the metamps of <i>H. panicea</i> will be found in Bowerbank's useful Monograph.<a
  id="NtA_195" href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page169"><span class="smaller">{169}</span></span></div>

  <p>The colour of the species is as inconstant as its form, ranging from green to light brown and
  orange. MacMunn concludes from spectroscopic work that <i>H. panicea</i>, contains at least three
  pigments, a chlorophyll, a lipochrome, and a histohaematin.<a id="NtA_196"
  href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> Lipochromes vary from red to yellow, chlorophyll is always
  associated with one or more of them. Histohaematin is a respiratory pigment. Proof has not yet
  been adduced that the chlorophyll is proper to the sponge and is not contained in symbiotic
  algae.</p>

  <p>In spite of all this inconstancy <i>H. panicea</i>, is one of the most easily determined
  species. It is only necessary to dry a small fragment, including the upper surface; a beautiful
  honeycomb-like structure is then visible on this surface, and among British sponges this is a
  property peculiar to the species (Bowerbank). Whatever the form of the sponge, one or more large
  rounded apertures are always present on the exterior; these are the "oscula." In the encrusting
  metamp the oscula are flush with the general surface, while in the other cases they are raised on
  conical projections; fistular specimens carry the osculum at the distal end, and the cockscomb has
  a row of them along its upper edge. Much more numerous than the oscula are smaller apertures
  scattered over the general surface of the sponge, and known as "ostia."</p>

      panicea</i>, from dried specimen. <b>A</b>, natural size; <b>B</b>, magnified. The large
      shaded patches are ostia.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If the sponge be placed in a shallow glass dish of sea water the function of the orifices can
  be made out with the naked eye, especially if a little powdered chalk or carmine be added to the
  water. If the specimen has been gathered after the retreating tide has left it exposed for some
  time, this addition is unnecessary, for as soon as it is plunged into water its current bursts
  vigorously forth, and is rendered visible by the particles of detritus that have accumulated in
  the interior during the period of <span class="pagenum" id="page170"><span
  class="smaller">{170}</span></span>exposure and consequent suspended activity. The oscula then
  serve for the exit of currents of water carrying particles of solid matter, while the entrance of
  water is effected through the ostia.</p>

  <p>Sections show that the ostia lead into spaces below the thin superficial layer or "dermal
  membrane"; these are continued down into the deeper parts of the sponge as the "incurrent canals,"
  irregular winding passages of lumen continually diminishing as they descend. They all sooner or
  later open by numerous small pores&mdash;"prosopyles"&mdash;into certain subspherical sacs termed
  flagellated chambers. Each chamber discharges by one wide aperture&mdash;"apopyle"&mdash;into an
  "excurrent canal." This latter is only distinguishable from an incurrent canal by the difference
  in its mode of communication with the chambers.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig64.jpg"><img style="width:43%" src="images/fig64.jpg" alt="fig64"

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 64.</span>&mdash;<i>H. panicea</i>: the arrows indicate
      the direction of the current, which is made visible by coloured particles. (After Grant.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The excurrent canals convey to the osculum the water which has passed through the ostia and
  chambers. All the peripheral parts of the sponge from which chambers are absent are termed the
  "ectosome," while the chamber-bearing regions are the "choanosome."</p>

  <p>The peculiar crumb-of-bread consistency is due to the nature of the skeleton, which is formed
  of irregular bundles and strands of minute needles or spicules composed of silica hydrate, a
  substance familiar to us in another form as opal: they are clear and transparent like glass. They
  are scattered through the tissues in great abundance.</p>

  <p>The classes of cellular elements in the sponge are as follows: Flattened cells termed
  "pinacocytes" cover all the free surfaces, that is to say, the external surface and the walls of
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page171"><span class="smaller">{171}</span></span>excurrent and
  incurrent canals. The flagellated chambers are lined by "choanocytes" (cf. Fig. 70, p. <a
  href="#page176">176</a>); these are cells provided at their inner end with a flagellum and a
  collar surrounding it. They resemble individuals of the Protozoan sub-class Choanoflagellata, and
  the likeness is the more remarkable because no other organisms are known to possess such cells.
  Taken together the choanocytes constitute the "gastral layer," and they are the active elements in
  producing the current. The tissue surrounding the chambers thus lying between the excurrent and
  incurrent canals consists of a gelatinous matrix colonised by cells drawn from two distinct
  sources. In the first place, it contains cells which have a common origin with the pinacocytes,
  and which together with them make up the "dermal layer"; these are the "collencytes" and
  "scleroblasts"; secondly, it contains "archaeocytes," cells of independent origin.</p>

  <p>Collencytes are cells with clear protoplasm and thread-like pseudopodial processes; they are
  distinguished as stellate or bipolar, according as these processes are many or only two.
  Scleroblasts or spicule cells are at first rounded, but become elongated with the growth of the
  spicule they secrete, and when fully grown are consequently fusiform.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Each spicule consists of an organic filamentar axis or axial fibre around which sheaths of
  silica hydrate are deposited successively by the scleroblast. Over the greater length of the
  spicule the sheaths are cylindrical, but at each end they taper to a point. The axial canal in
  which the axial fibre lies is open at both ends, and the fibre is continuous at these two points
  with an organic sheath, which invests the entire spicule. From this structure we may conclude that
  the spicule grows at both ends&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it grows in two opposite directions along one
  line&mdash;it has two rays lying in one axis, and is classed among uniaxial diactinal spicules.
  Being <span class="pagenum" id="page172"><span class="smaller">{172}</span></span>pointed at both
  ends it receives the special name <i>oxea</i>. The lamination of the spicule is rendered much more

  <p>The archaeocytes are rounded amoeboid cells early set apart in the larva; they are practically
  undifferentiated blastomeres. Some of them become reproductive elements, and thus afford a good

  <p>The reproductive elements are ova and spermatozoa, and are to be found in all stages in the
  dermal jelly. Dendy states that the eggs are fertilised in the inhalant canals, to which position
  they migrate by amoeboid movements, and there become suspended by a peduncle.</p>

  <p>The larva has unfortunately not been described, but as the course of development among the near
  relatives of <i>H. panicea</i> is known to be fairly constant, it will be convenient to give a
  description of a "Halichondrine type" of larva based on Maas' account of the development of
  <i>Gellius varius</i>.<a id="NtA_199" href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> The free-swimming larvae
  escape by the osculum; they are minute oval bodies moving rapidly by means of a covering of cilia.
  The greater part of the body is a dazzling white, while the hinder pole is of a brown violet
  colour. This coloured patch is non-ciliate, the general covering of cilia ending at its edge in a
  ring of cilia twice the length of the others. Forward <span class="pagenum" id="page173"><span
  class="smaller">{173}</span></span>movement takes place in a screw line; when this ceases the
  larva rests on its hinder pole, and the cilia cause it to turn round on its axis.</p>

  <p>Sections show that the larva is built up of two layers<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>1. "The inner mass," consisting of various kinds of cells in a gelatinous matrix.</p>

  <p>2. A high flagellated epithelium, which entirely covers the larva with the exception of the
  hinder pole.</p>

      <i>x</i>, surface of hinder pole. (After Maas.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The cells in the inner mass are classified into (1) undifferentiated cells, recognised by their
  nucleus, which possesses a nucleolus; these are the archaeocytes; (2) differentiated cells, of
  which the nucleus contains a chromatin net; these give rise to pinacocytes, collencytes, and
  scleroblasts. Some of them form a flat epithelium, which covers the hinder pole. Some of the
  scleroblasts already contain spicules. Fixation occurs very early. The front pole is used for
  attachment, the pigmented pole becoming the distal end (Fig. 69). The larva flattens out, the
  margin of the attached end is produced into radiating pseudopodial processes. The flagellated
  cells retreat to the interior, leaving the inner mass exposed, and some of its cells thereupon
  form a flat outer epithelium. This is the most important process of the metamorphosis; it is
  followed by a pause in the outward changes, coinciding in time with rearrangements of the internal
  cells to give rise to the canal system; that is to say, lacunae arise in the inner mass,
  pinacocytes pass to the surface of the lacunae, and form their lining; the flagellated cells,
  which have lain in confusion, become grouped in small clusters. These become flagellated chambers,
  communications are established between the various portions of the canal system, and its external
  apertures arise. There is at first only one osculum. The larvae may be obtained by keeping the
  parent sponge in a dish of sea water, shielded from too bright a light, and surrounded by a second
  dish of water to keep the temperature constant. They will undergo <span class="pagenum"
  id="page174"><span class="smaller">{174}</span></span>metamorphosis in sea water which is
  constantly changed, and will live for some days.</p>

  <p>We have said that the young sponge has only one osculum. This is the only organ which is
  present in unit number, and it is natural to ask whether perhaps the osculum may not be taken as a
  mark of the individual; whether the fistular specimens, for example, of <i>H. panicea</i> may not
  be solitary individuals, and the cockscomb and other forms colonies in which the individuals are
  merged to different degrees. Into the metaphysics of such a view we cannot enter here. We must be
  content to refer to the views of Huxley and of Spencer on Individuality.</p>

  <p>But it is advisable to avoid speaking of a multi-osculate sponge as a colony of many
  individuals, even in the sense in which it is usual to speak of a colony of polyps as formed of
  individuals. The repetition of oscula is probably to be regarded as an example of the phenomenon
  of repetition of parts, the almost universal occurrence of which has been emphasised by Bateson.<a
  id="NtA_200" href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> Delage<a id="NtA_201"
  href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> has shown that when two sponge larvae fixed side by side fuse
  together, the resulting product has but one osculum. This, though seeming to bear out our point of
  view, loses weight in this connexion, when it is recalled that two Echinoderm larvae fused

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Ephydatia fluviatilis.</b></p>

  <p>In the fresh water of our rivers, ponds, and lakes, sponges are represented very commonly by
  <i>Ephydatia (Spongilla) fluviatilis</i>, a cosmopolitan species. The search for specimens is most
  likely <span class="pagenum" id="page175"><span class="smaller">{175}</span></span>to be
  successful if perpendicular timbers such as lock-gates are examined, or the underside of floating
  logs or barges, or overhanging branches of trees which dip beneath the surface of the water.</p>

  <p>The sponge is sessile and massive, seldom forming branches, and is often to be found in great
  luxuriance of growth, masses of many pounds weight having been taken off barges in the Thames. The
  colour ranges from flesh-tint to green, according to the exposure to light. This fact is dealt
  with in a most interesting paper by Professor Lankester,<a id="NtA_202"
  href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> who has shown not only that the green colour is due to the
  presence of chlorophyll, but that the colouring matter is contained in corpuscles similar to the
  chlorophyll corpuscles of green plants, and, further, that the flesh-coloured specimens contain
  colourless corpuscles, which, though differing in shape from those which contain the green
  pigment, are in all probability converted into these latter under the influence of sufficient
  light. The corpuscles, both green and colourless, are contained in amoeboid cells of the dermal
  layer;<a id="NtA_203" href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> and in the same cells but not in the
  corpuscles are to be found amyloid substances.</p>

  <p>The anatomy of <i>Ephydatia fluviatilis</i> is very similar to that of <i>Halichondria
  panicea</i>, differing only in one or two points of importance. The ectosome is an aspiculous
  membrane of dermal tissue covering the whole exterior of the sponge and forming the roof of a
  continuous subdermal space. This dermal membrane is perforated by innumerable ostia, and is
  supported above the subdermal cavity by means of skeletal strands, which traverse the subdermal
  cavity and raise the dermal membrane into tent-like elevations, termed conuli. The inhalant canals
  which arise from the floor of the subdermal cavity are as irregular as in <i>H. panicea</i>, and
  interdigitate with equally irregular exhalant canals; these latter communicate with the oscular
  tubes. Between the two sets of canals are the thin folds of the choanosome with its small
  subspherical chambers provided with widely open apopyles (Fig. 70). The soft parts are supported
  on a siliceous skeleton of oxeas, which may have a quite smooth surface or may <span
  class="pagenum" id="page176"><span class="smaller">{176}</span></span>be covered in various
  degrees with minute conical spines (Fig. 72, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>). These spicules are connected by
  means of a substance termed <i>spongin</i> deposited around their overlapping ends, so as to form
  an irregular network of strands, of which some may be distinguished as main strands or fibres,
  others as connecting fibres. In the main fibres several spicules lie side by side, while in the
  connecting fibres fewer or frequently single spicules form the thickness of the fibre. The fibres
  are continuous at the base with a plate or skin of spongin, which is secreted over the lower
  surface of the sponge and intervenes between it and the substratum. Of the chemical composition of
  spongin we shall speak later (see p. <a href="#page237">237</a>). It is a substance which reaches
  a great importance in some of the higher sponges, and forms the entire skeleton of certain kinds
  of bath sponge. Lying loose in the soft parts and hence termed flesh spicules, or microscleres,
  are minute spicules of peculiar form. These are the amphidiscs, consisting of a shaft with a
  many-rayed disc at each end (Fig. 72).</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In addition to its habitat the fresh-water sponge is worthy of attention on account of its
  methods of reproduction, which have arisen in adaptation to the habitat. A similar adaptation is
  widespread among fresh-water members of most aquatic invertebrates.<a id="NtA_204"

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page177"><span class="smaller">{177}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Ephydatia fluviatilis</i> normally produces not only free-swimming larvae of sexual origin,
  but also internal gemmules arising asexually. These bodies appear in autumn, distributed
  throughout the sponge, often more densely in the deeper layers, and they come into activity only
  after the death of the parent, an event which happens in this climate at the approach of
  winter.</p>

  <p>Weltner<a id="NtA_205" href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> has shown that on the death and
  disintegration of the mother sponge some of the gemmules remain attached to the old skeleton, some
  sink and some float. Those which remain attached are well known to reclothe the dead fibres with
  living tissue. They inherit, as it were, the advantages of position, which contributed to the
  survival of the parent, as one of the selected fittest. The gemmules which sink are doubtless
  rolled short distances along the bottom, while those which float have the opportunity of widely
  distributing the species with the risk of being washed out to sea. But even these floating
  gemmules are exposed to far less dangers than the delicate free-swimming larvae, for their soft
  parts are protected from shocks by a thick coat armed with amphidiscs.</p>

  <p>The gemmules are likewise remarkable for their powers of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page178"><span class="smaller">{178}</span></span>resistance to climatic conditions, powers
  which must contribute in no small way to the survival of a species exposed to the variable
  temperatures of fresh water. Thus, if the floating gemmules or the parent skeleton with its
  attached and dormant offspring should chance to be included in the surface layer of ice during the
  winter, so far from suffering any evil consequences they appear to benefit by these conditions.
  Both Potts and Weltner have confirmed the truth of this statement by experiments. Weltner
  succeeded in rearing young from gemmules which had suffered a total exposure of 17 days to a
  temperature "under 0&deg; C."</p>

  <p>Of important bearing on the question of the utility of the gemmules are certain instances in
  which <i>E. fluviatilis</i> has been recorded as existing in a perennial condition.<a id="NtA_206"
  href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> The perennial individuals may or may not bear gemmules, which
  makes it evident that, with the acquisition of the power to survive the winter cold, the prime
  necessity of forming these bodies vanishes.</p>

  <p>The perennial specimens are described as exhibiting a diminished vegetative activity in winter,
  the flagellated chambers may be absent (Lieberk&uuml;hn), or present in unusually small numbers
  (Weltner), the entire canal system may be absent (Metschnikoff), or, on the other hand, it may be
  complete except for the osculum.</p>

  <p>In tropical countries gemmulation occurs as a defence against the ravages caused by the dry
  season when the waters recede down their banks, exposing all or most of their sponge inhabitants
  to the direct rays of the sun. The sponges are at once killed, but the contained gemmules being
  thoroughly dried, become efficient distributing agents of the species; they are light enough to be
  carried on the wind. It is probable that those individual sponges which escape desiccation survive
  the dry season without forming gemmules.</p>

  <p>It has been shown experimentally that gemmules are not injured by drying&mdash;Zykoff found
  that gemmules kept dry for a period of two years had not lost the power of germination.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page179"><span class="smaller">{179}</span></span></div>

  <p>The mature gemmules consist of a more or less spherical mass of cells, which we shall refer to
  as yolk cells, and of a complex coat. The latter is provided with a pore or pore tube (Fig. 74)
  which is closed in winter by an organic membrane.</p>

  <p>There are three layers in the coat: an inner chitinous layer surrounded by an air-chamber
  layer, which is finely vesicular, showing a structure recalling plant tissue, and containing
  amphidiscs arranged along radii passing through the centre of the gemmule. One of the discs of
  each amphidisc lies in the inner chitinous coat, while the other lies in a similar membrane which
  envelopes the air-chamber layer and is termed the outer chitinous coat.</p>

  <p>Marshall has suggested that one function of the amphidiscs is to weight the gemmules and thus
  protect them against the force of the river current; and no doubt the sinking or floating of
  individual gemmules depends on the relative degree of development of the air-chambers and of the
  amphidiscs.</p>

  <p>A study of the development of <i>Ephydatia</i> gemmules vividly illustrates various characters
  of the inner processes of sponges. Specially noteworthy are the migrations of cells and the slight
  extent to which division of labour is carried: one and the same cell will be found to perform
  various functions.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The beginning of a gemmule is first recognisable<a id="NtA_207"
  href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> as a small cluster of amoeboid archaeocytes in the dermal
  membrane. These move into the deeper parts of the sponge to form larger groups. They are the
  essential part of the gemmule, the yolk cells, which, when germination takes place, give rise to a
  new sponge. They are followed by two distinct troops of actively moving cells. Those forming the
  first troop arrange themselves round the yolk cells and ultimately assume a columnar form so that
  they make an epithelioid layer. They then secrete the inner chitinous coat. The cells of the
  second troop are entrusted with the nutrition of the gemmule. Consequently they pass in among the
  yolk cells, distribute their food supplies, and make their escape <span class="pagenum"
  id="page180"><span class="smaller">{180}</span></span>by returning into the tissues of the mother
  sponge, before the columnar cells have completed the chitinous coat. Yet another migration now
  occurs, the cells&mdash;"scleroblasts"&mdash;which have been occupied in secreting amphidiscs at
  various stations in the sponge, carry the fully formed spicules to the gemmules and place them
  radially round the yolk cells between the radially lying cells of the columnar layer. The
  scleroblasts themselves remain with the amphidiscs, and becoming modified, contribute to the
  formation of the air-chamber layer. The columnar cells now creep out between the amphidiscs till
  their inner ends rest on the outer ends of these spicules. They then secrete the outer chitinous
  coat and return to the mother sponge.</p>

  <p>Carter gives directions<a id="NtA_208" href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> for obtaining young
  sponges from the gemmules. The latter should be removed from the parent, cleaned by rolling in a
  handkerchief, and then placed in water in a watch-glass, protected with a glass cover and exposed
  to sunlight. In a few days the contents of the gemmule issue from the foramen and can be seen as a
  white speck. A few hours later the young sponge is already active and may be watched producing
  aqueous currents. At this age the sponge is an excellent object for studying in the living
  condition: being both small and transparent it affords us an opportunity of watching the movements
  of particles of carmine as they are carried by the current through the chambers.</p>

  <p>Potts<a id="NtA_209" href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a> describes how he has followed the
  transportal of spicules by dermal cells, the end of each spicule multiplying the motion, swaying
  like an oscillating rod.</p>

  <p>In <i>E. fluviatilis</i> reproduction also occurs during the warmer months in this climate by
  means of sexual larvae. These are interesting for certain aberrant features in their
  metamorphosis.<a id="NtA_210" href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> While some of the flagellated
  chambers are formed in the normal way from the flagellated cells of the larva, others arise each
  by division of a single archaeocyte. This, it is suggested, is correlated with the acquisition of
  the method of reproduction by gemmules, the peculiarities (<i>i.e.</i> development of organs from
  archaeocytes) of which are appearing in the larvae.</p>

  <p><b>Definition.</b>&mdash;We may now define sponges as multicellular, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page181"><span class="smaller">{181}</span></span>two-layered animals; with pores perforating
  the body-walls and admitting a current of water, which is set up by the collared cells of the
  "gastral" layer.</p>

  <p><b>Position in the Animal Kingdom.</b>&mdash;Sponges are the only multicellular animals which
  possess choanocytes, and their mode of feeding is unique. Since they are two-layered it has been
  sought to associate them with the Metazoan phylum Coelenterata, but they are destitute of
  nematocysts or any other form of stinging cell, and their generative cells arise from a class of
  embryonic cells set apart from the first, while the generative cells of Coelenterata are derived
  from the ectoderm, or in other cases from the endoderm. These weighty differences between sponges
  and that group of Metazoa to which they would, if of Metazoan nature at all, be most likely to
  show resemblance, suggest that we should seek a separate origin for sponges and Metazoa. We
  naturally turn to the Choanoflagellate Infusorian stock (see p. <a href="#page121">121</a>) as the
  source of Porifera, leaving the Ciliate stock as the progenitors of Metazoa.</p>

  <p>That both Porifera and Metazoa are reproduced by ova and spermatozoa is no objection to this
  view, seeing that the occurrence of similar reproductive cells has been demonstrated in certain
  Protozoa (see pp. <a href="#page100">100</a>, <a href="#page128">128</a>).</p>

  <p>Let us now see which view is borne out by facts of embryology. Suppose, for the moment, we
  regard sponges as Metazoa, then if the sponge larva be compared with the Metazoan larva we must
  assign the large granular cells to the endoderm; the flagellated cells to the ectoderm; and we are
  led to the anomalous statement that the digestive cells in the adult are ectodermal, the covering,
  outer cells endodermal; or conversely, if we start our comparisons with the adults, then it
  follows that the larval ectoderm has the characters of an endoderm, and the larval endoderm those
  of an ectoderm.</p>

  <p>Thus both embryology and morphology lead us to the same point, they both show that in the
  absence of any fundamental agreement between Porifera and Metazoa it is necessary to regard the
  two stocks as independent from the very first, and hence the name <span class="sc">Parazoa</span>
  (Sollas) has been given to the group which contains the Porifera as its only known phylum.</p>

  <p>Interesting in connexion with the phylogeny of Parazoa is the Choanoflagellate genus
  <i>Proterospongia</i> (Fig. 75), described by <span class="pagenum" id="page182"><span
  class="smaller">{182}</span></span>Saville Kent, and since rediscovered both in England and
  abroad.<a id="NtA_211" href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> This is a colony of unicellular
  individuals embedded in a common jelly. The individuals at the surface are choanoflagellate, while
  in the interior the cells are rounded or amoeboid, and some of them undergo multiple fission to
  form reproductive cells. This is just such a creature as we might imagine that ancestral stage to
  have been of which the free-swimming sponge larva is a reminiscence: for we have seen that the
  flagellated cells of the larva are potential choanocytes.</p>

  such important weapons in the hands of the systematist that it is convenient to name them
  according to a common scheme. This has been arrived at by considering first the number of axes
  along which the main branches of the spicules are distributed, and secondly whether growth has
  occurred in each of these axes in one or both directions from a point of origin.<a id="NtA_213"
  href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

  <p>I. <i>Monaxons.</i>&mdash;Spicules of rod-like form, in which growth is directed from a single

  <p>Biradiate monaxon spicules are termed "rhabdi" (Fig. 76, <i>a</i>). A rhabdus pointed at both
  ends is an "oxea," rounded at both ends a "strongyle," knobbed at both ends a "tylote." By
  branching a rhabdus may become a "triaene" (Fig. 110, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>).</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS CALCAREA</p>

  <p class="sp3">Calcarea are marine shallow-water forms attached for the most part directly by the
  basal part of the body or occasionally by the intervention of a stalk formed of dermal tissue.
  They are almost all white or pale grey brown in colour. Their spicules are either monaxon or
  tetraxon or both. The tetraxons are either quadriradiate and then called "calthrops," or
  triradiate when the fourth actine is absent. The triradiates always lie more or less tangentially
  in the body-wall; similarly three rays of a calthrop are tangentially placed, the fourth lying
  across the thickness of the wall. It is convenient to include the triradiate and the three
  tangentially placed rays of a calthrop under the common <span class="pagenum" id="page185"><span
  class="smaller">{185}</span></span>term "triradiate system" (Minchin). The three rays of one of
  these systems may all be equal in length and meet at equal angles: in this case the system is
  "regular." Or one ray or one angle may differ in size from the other rays or angles respectively,
  which are equal: in either of these two cases the system is bilaterally symmetrical and is termed
  "sagittal." A special name "alate" is given to those systems which are sagittal in consequence of
  the inequality in the angles. Thus all equiangular systems whether sagittal or not are opposed to
  those which are alate. This is the natural classification.<a id="NtA_214"
  href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Class I. Homocoela.</b></p>

  <p>The Homocoela or Ascons possess the simplest known type of canal system, and by this they are
  defined. The body is a sac, branched in the adult, but simple in the young; its continuous cavity
  is everywhere lined with choanocytes, its wall is traversed by inhalant pores, and its cavity
  opens to the exterior at the distal end by an osculum. The simple sac-like young is the well-known
  Olynthus of Haeckel&mdash;the starting-point from which all sponges seem to have set out. Two
  processes are involved in the passage from the young to the adult, namely, multiplication of
  oscula and branching of the original Olynthus tube or sac. If the formation of a new osculum is
  accompanied by fission of the sac, and the branching of the latter is slight, there arises an
  adult formed of a number of erect, well separated main tubes, each with one osculum and lateral
  branches. Such is the case in the <b>Leucosoleniidae</b>. In the <b>Clathrinidae</b>, on the other
  hand, branching of the Olynthus is complicated, giving rise to what is termed reticulate body
  form, that is, a sponge body consisting of a network of tubules with several oscula, but with no
  external indication of the limits between the portions drained by each osculum. These outward
  characters form a safe basis for classification, because they are correlated with other
  fundamental differences in structure and development.<a id="NtA_215"
  href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As in <i>Halichondria</i>, and in fact all sponges, the body-wall is formed of two layers; the
  gastral layer, as we have said, forming a continuous lining to the Ascon tube and its branches.
  The <span class="pagenum" id="page186"><span class="smaller">{186}</span></span>dermal layer
  includes a complete outer covering of pinacocytes, which is reflected over the oscular rim to meet
  the gastral layer at the distal end of the tube; a deeper gelatinous stratum in which lie
  scleroblasts and their secreted products&mdash;calcareous spicules; and finally porocytes.<a

  thickness of the thin body-wall, and are perforated by a duct or pore. The porocytes are
  contractile, and so the pores may be opened or closed; they are a type of cell which is known only
  in Calcarea. It will be noticed that the fusiform or stellate "connective tissue cells" are
  absent. The layer of pinacocytes as a whole is highly contractile, and is capable of diminishing

  <p>The choanocytes show certain constant differences in structure in the families Clathrinidae and

  <p>The tetraxon spicules have "equiangular" triradiate systems in the Clathrinidae, while in

  <p class="sp3">The fact that it is possible to classify the Calcarea Homocoela largely by means of
  histological characters is in accordance with the importance of the individual cell as opposed to
  the cell-layers generally throughout the Porifera, and is interesting in serving to emphasise the
  low grade of organisation of the Phylum. The organs of sponges are often unicellular (pores), or
  the products of the activity of a single cell (many skeletal elements); and even in the gastral

  <p>The Heterocoela present a series of forms of successive grades of complexity, all derivable
  from the Ascons, from which they differ in having a discontinuous gastral layer. The simplest
  Heterocoela are included in the family <b>Sycettidae</b>, of which the British representative is
  <i>Sycon</i> (Fig. 79). In <i>Sycon</i> numerous tubular flagellated chambers are arranged
  radially round a central cavity, the "paragaster," into which they open (Figs. 78, 79). The
  chambers, which are here often called radial tubes, are close set, leaving more or less
  quadrangular tubular spaces, the <span class="pagenum" id="page188"><span
  class="smaller">{188}</span></span>inhalant canals, between them; and where the walls of adjacent
  chambers come in contact, fusion may take place. Pores guarded by porocytes put the inhalant
  canals into communication with the flagellated chambers. The paragaster is lined by pinacocytes;
  choanocytes are confined to the flagellated chambers.</p>

  <p>The skeleton is partly defensive, partly supporting; one set of spicules strengthens the walls
  of the radial tubes and forms collectively the "tubar skeleton." It is characteristic of
  Sycettidae that the tubar skeleton is of the type known as "articulate"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it is
  formed of a number of successive rings of spicules, instead of consisting of a single ring of
  large spicules which run the whole length of the tube.</p>

  <p>The walls of the paragaster are known as the "gastral cortex"; they contain quadriradiate
  spicules, of which the triradiate systems lie tangentially in the gastral cortex, while the apical
  ray projects into the paragaster, and is no doubt defensive. The distal ends of the chambers
  bristle with tufts of oxeate spicules, and the separate chambers are distinguishable in surface
  view. It is interesting to notice that in some species of <i>Sycon</i>, the gaps between the
  distal ends of the chambers are covered over by a delicate perforated membrane, thus leading on,
  as we shall see presently, to the next stage of advance.<a id="NtA_219"

  an isolated radial tube of <i>Sycon</i>. Figs. 81, 82 show the same sponge, somewhat older. From
  them it is seen that the <i>Sycon</i> type is produced from the young individual, in what <span
  class="pagenum" id="page189"><span class="smaller">{189}</span></span>may be called its Ascon
  stage, by a process of outgrowth of tubes from its walls, followed by restriction of choanocytes

  href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> that this latter event is brought about by immigration of

  The dermal thickenings above neighbouring chambers extend laterally and <span class="pagenum"

  tissue perforated by dermal ostia, which open into the inhalant canals, and strengthened by stout
  spicules running longitudinally. This layer is termed a cortex; it covers the whole sponge,
  compacting the radial tubes so that they form, together with the cortex, a secondary wall to the
  sponge, which is once more a simple sac, but with a complex wall. The cortex may be enormously
  developed, so as to form more than half the thickness of the wall (Fig. 84). The chambers taken
  together are spoken of as the chamber layer.</p>

  <p>We have already alluded to the resemblance between a young Ascon person and a radial tube of
  <i>Sycon</i>&mdash;a comparison which calls to mind the somewhat strange view of certain earlier
  authors, that the flagellated chambers are really the sponge individuals. If now we suppose each
  Ascon-like radial tube of <i>Sycon</i> to undergo that same process of growth by which the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page191"><span class="smaller">{191}</span></span><i>Sycon</i> itself was
  derived from the Ascon, we shall then have a sponge with a canal system of the type seen in
  <i>Leucandra</i> among British forms, but more diagrammatically shown in the foreign genus
  <i>Leucilla</i> (Fig. 85). The foregoing remarks do not pretend to give an account of the
  transition from <i>Sycon</i> to <i>Leucilla</i> as it occurred in phylogeny. For some indication
  of this we must await embryological research.</p>

  <p>In <i>Leucandra</i> the fundamental structure is obscured by the irregularity of its canal
  system. It shows a further and most important difference from <i>Leucilla</i> in the smaller size
  and rounded form of its chambers. This change of form marks an advance in efficiency; for now the
  flagella converge to a centre, so that they all act on the same drop of water, while in the
  tubular chamber their action is more widely distributed and proportionately less intense (see p.
  <a href="#page236">236</a>).</p>

  <p>Above are described three main types of canal system&mdash;that of Homocoela, of <i>Sycon</i>,
  and of <i>Leucandra</i> and <i>Leucilla</i>. These are conveniently termed the first, second, and
  third types respectively, and may be briefly described as related to one another somewhat in the
  same way as a scape, umbel, and compound umbel among <span class="pagenum" id="page192"><span
  class="smaller">{192}</span></span>inflorescences. These types formed the basis of Haeckel's
  famous classification.<a id="NtA_221" href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a> It has, however, been
  concluded<a id="NtA_222" href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> that the skeleton is a safer guide in
  taxonomy, at any rate for the smaller subdivisions; and in modern classifications genera with
  canal systems of the third type will be found distributed among various families; while in the
  Grantiidae, <i>Ute</i> and <i>Leucandra</i> stand side by side. This treatment implies a belief
  that the third type of canal system has been independently and repeatedly evolved within the
  Calcarea&mdash;an example of a phenomenon, homoplasy, strikingly displayed throughout the group.
  It is, remarkably enough, the case that all the canal systems found in the remainder of the
  Porifera are more or less modified forms of one or other of the second two types of canal system
  above described.</p>

  <p>The families Grantiidae, Heteropidae, and Amphoriscidae, all possessing a dermal cortex, are
  distinguished as follows:&mdash;The <b>Grantiidae</b> by the absence of subdermal sagittal
  triradiate spicules and of conspicuous subgastral quadriradiates; the <b>Heteropidae</b> by the
  presence of sagittal triradiates; the <b>Amphoriscidae</b> by the presence of conspicuous
  subgastral quadriradiates.</p>

  <p>Two families of Calcarea, possibly allied, remain for special mention&mdash;the Pharetronidae,
  a family rich in genera, and containing almost all the fossil forms of the group, and the
  Astroscleridae.</p>

  <p>The <b>Pharetronidae</b> are with one, or perhaps two exceptions, fossil forms, having in
  common the arrangement of the spicules of their main skeletal framework in fibres. The family is
  divided into two sub-families<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><b>I. Dialytinae.</b>&mdash;The spicules are not fused to one another; the exact mode of their
  union into fibres is unknown, but an organic cement may be present.</p>

  <p><i>Lelapia australis</i>, a recent species, should probably be placed here as the sole living
  representative. Dendy has shown<a id="NtA_223" href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> that this
  remarkable species has a skeleton of the same fibrous character as is found in typical Dialytinae,
  and that the triradiate spicules in the fibres undergo a modification into the "tuning-fork" type
  (Fig. 86, C), to enable them to be compacted into smooth fibres. <span class="pagenum"

  <i>Petrostroma schulzei</i><a id="NtA_224" href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a> lives in shallow

  is a genus erected by Po&#x010D;ta for a sponge from Cenomanian beds of Bohemia. Doederlein, in
  1896, expressed his opinion that fossil representatives of Lithoninae would most surely be
  discovered. The fused spicules are equiangular quadriradiates; they are united in
  <i>Petrostroma</i> by lateral fusion of the rays, in <i>Plectroninia</i> (Fig. 87) and
  <i>Porosphaera</i> by <span class="pagenum" id="page194"><span
  class="smaller">{194}</span></span>fusion of apposed terminal flat expansions of the rays, and in
  some, possibly all, genera a continuous deposit of calcium carbonate ensheaths the spicular
  reticulum. Thus they recall the formation of the skeleton on the one hand of the Lithistida and on
  the other of the Dictyonine Hexactinellida (see pp. <a href="#page202">202</a>, <a
  href="#page211">211</a>). "Tuning-forks" may occur in the dermal membrane.</p>

  the calcium carbonate of the skeleton is present as calcite, in <i>Astrosclera</i> as aragonite,
  and the elements are solid polyhedra, <span class="pagenum" id="page195"><span
  class="smaller">{195}</span></span>united by their surfaces to the total exclusion of soft parts
  (Fig. 88). Each element consists of crystalline fibres radially disposed around a few central
  granules, and terminating peripherally in contact with the fibres of adjacent elements. Young
  polyhedra are to be found free in the soft parts at the surface. The chambers are exceptionally
  minute, especially for a calcareous sponge, comparing with those of other sponges as follows<span

  <p class="sp3">In its outward form <i>Astrosclera</i> resembles certain Pharetronids. The minute
  dimensions of the ciliated chambers relegate <i>Astrosclera</i> to the Micromastictora, and the
  fortunate fact that the calcium carbonate of its skeleton possesses the mineral characters not of
  calcite, but of aragonite, renders it less difficult to conceive that its relations may be rather
  with the non-calcareous than the calcareous sponges.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">BRANCH II. MICROMASTICTORA</p>

  <p>All sponges which do not possess calcareous skeletons are characterised by choanocytes, which,
  when compared with those of Calcarea, are conspicuous for their smaller size. The great majority
  (Silicispongiae) of the non-calcareous sponges either secrete siliceous skeletons or are connected
  with siliceous sponges by a nicely graded series of forms. The small remainder are entirely
  askeletal. All these non-calcareous sponges are included, under the title Micromastictora, in a
  natural group, opposed to the Megamastictora as of equal value.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The subdivision of the Micromastictora is a matter of some difficulty. The
  Hexactinellida alone are a well circumscribed group. After their separation there remains, besides
  the askeletal genera, an assemblage of forms, the Demospongiae, which fall into two main tribes.
  These betray their relationship by series of intermediate types, but a clue is wanting which shall
  determine decisively the direction in which the series are to be read. The askeletal genera are
  the <i>crux</i> of the systematist. It is perhaps safest, while recognising that many of them bear
  a likeness of <span class="pagenum" id="page196"><span class="smaller">{196}</span></span>one kind
  or another to various Micromastictora, to retain them together in a temporary class, the
  Myxospongiae.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS I. MYXOSPONGIAE</p>

  <p>The class Myxospongiae is a purely artificial one, containing widely divergent forms, which
  possess a common negative character, namely, the absence of a skeleton. As a result of this
  absence they are all encrusting in habit.</p>

  <p>One genus, <i>Hexadella</i>, has been regarded by its discoverer Topsent<a id="NtA_229"
  href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> as an Hexactinellid. The same authority places
  <i>Oscarella</i> with the Tetractinellida; it is more difficult to suggest the direction in which
  we are to seek the relations of the remaining type, <i>Halisarca</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Hexadella</i>, from the coast of France, is a remarkable little rose-coloured or bright
  yellow sponge, with large sac-like flagellated chambers and a very lacunar ectosome.</p>

  <p><i>Oscarella</i> is a brightly coloured sponge, with a characteristic velvety surface; it is a
  British genus, but by no means confined to our shores. Its canal system has been described by some
  authors as diplodal, by others as eurypylous. Topsent<a id="NtA_230"
  href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> has shown, and we can confirm his statement, that though the
  chambers have usually the narrow afferent and efferent ductules of a diplodal system, yet since
  each one may communicate with two or three canals, the canal system cannot be described as
  diplodal. The hypophare attains a great development, and in it the generative products mature. The
  pinacocytes, like those of Plakinidae, and perhaps of <i>Aplysilla</i>, are flagellated.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Halisarca</i>, also British, is easily distinguished from <i>Oscarella</i> by
  the presence of a mucus-like secretion which oozes from it, and by the absence of the bright
  coloration characteristic of <i>Oscarella</i>. It naturally suggests itself that the coloration in
  the one case and the secretion in the other are protective, and in this respect perform one of the
  functions of the skeleton of other sponges. The chambers are long, tubular, and branched. There is
  no hypophare.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page197"><span class="smaller">{197}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS II. HEXACTINELLIDA<a id="NtA_231"
  href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Silicispongiae, defined by their spicules, of which the rays lie along three rectangular
  axes. The canal system is simple, with thimble-shaped chambers. The body-wall is divided into
  endosome, ectosome, and choanosome.</i></p>

  <p>Some authors would elevate the Hexactinellida to the position of a third main sub-group of
  Porifera, thus separating them from other siliceous sponges. In considering this view it is
  important to realise at the outset that they are deep-water forms. They bear evident traces of the
  influence of their habitat, and like others of the colonists of the deep sea, are impressed with
  marked archaic features. Yet they are still bound to other Micromastictora, first by the small
  size of their choanocytes, and secondly by the presence of siliceous spicules. This second
  character is really a double link, for it involves not merely the presence of silica in the
  skeleton, but also the presence in each spicule of a well-marked axial filament. Now this axial
  filament is a structure which is gaining in importance, for purposes of classification, in
  proportion as its absence in Calcarea is becoming more probable. The Hexactinellida are the only
  sponges, other than the bath sponge, which are at all generally known. They have won recognition
  by their beauty, as the bath sponge by its utility, and, like it, one of their number&mdash;the
  Venus's Flower-Basket&mdash;forms an important article of commerce, the chief fishery being in the
  Philippine Islands. This wonderful beauty belongs to the skeleton, and is greatly concealed when
  the soft parts are present.</p>

  <p>We have said that the Hexactinellids are deep-sea forms; they are either directly fixed to the
  bottom or more often moored in the ooze by long tufts of rooting spicules. In the "glass-rope
  sponge," the rooting tuft of long spicules, looking like a bundle of spun glass, is valued by the
  Japanese, who export it to us. In <i>Monorhaphis</i> the rooting tuft is replaced by a single
  giant spicule,<a id="NtA_232" href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a> three metres in length, and
  described as "of the thickness of a little finger"! Probably it is as a result of their fixed life
  in the calm waters of the deep sea<a id="NtA_233" href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> that <span
  class="pagenum" id="page198"><span class="smaller">{198}</span></span>Hexactinellids contrast with
  most other sponges by their symmetry. It should not, however, be forgotten that many of the
  Calcarea which inhabit shallow water exhibit almost as perfect a symmetry.</p>

  <p>The structure of the body-wall in Hexactinellida is so constant as to make it possible to give
  a general description applicable to all members of the group. It is of considerable thickness, but
  a large part is occupied by empty spaces, for the actual tissue is present in minimum quantity. In
  the wall the chamber-layer is suspended by trabeculae of soft tissue, between a dermal membrane on
  the outside and a similar gastral membrane on the inner side (Fig. 89). Thus the water entering
  the chambers through their numerous pores has first passed through the ostia in the dermal
  membrane and traversed the subdermal trabecular space; on leaving the chambers it flows through
  the subgastral trabecular space and the ostia in the gastral membrane, to enter the paragaster and
  leave the body at the osculum. The trabeculae and the dermal and gastral membranes together
  constitute the dermal layer. This conclusion is based on comparison with adults of the other
  groups, for in the absence of embryological knowledge no direct evidence is available. According
  to <span class="pagenum" id="page199"><span class="smaller">{199}</span></span>the Japanese
  investigator, Isao Ijima,<a id="NtA_234" href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> the dermal and
  gastral membranes are but expansions of the trabeculae, and the trabeculae themselves are entirely
  cellular, containing none of the gelatinous basis met with in the dermal layer of all other
  sponges. There is no surface layer of pinacocytes, the cells forming the trabeculae being all of
  one type, namely, irregularly branching cells, connected with one another by their branches to
  form a syncytium. In the trabeculae are found scleroblasts and archaeocytes.</p>

  <p>The chambers have a characteristic shape: they are variously described as "thimble-shaped,"
  "tubular," or "Syconate," and they open by wide mouths into the subgastral trabecular space. Their
  walls have been named the <i>membrana reticularis</i> from the fact that, when preserved with only
  ordinary precautions, they are seen as a regular network of protoplasmic strands, with square
  meshes and nuclei at the nodes. This appearance recently found an explanation when Schulze, for
  the first time, succeeded in preserving the collared cells of Hexactinellids.<a id="NtA_235"
  href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a> Schulze was then able to show that the choanocytes are not in
  contact with one another at their bases, where the nuclei are situated, but communicate with one
  another by stout protoplasmic strands. The form of the choanocyte can be seen in Fig. 91.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To Schulze's description of the chamber, Ijima has added the important contributions that every
  mesh in the reticulum functions as a chamber pore or prosopyle; and that porocytes, such as are
  found in Calcarea, are wanting. This structure of the chamber-walls, the absence of gelatinous
  basis in the dermal layer, and the slight degree of histological differentiation in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page200"><span class="smaller">{200}</span></span>the same layer, added to the
  more obvious character of thimble-shaped chambers, are the chief archaic features of Hexactinellid
  morphology.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The skeleton which supports the soft parts is, like them, simple and constant in its main
  features. It is secreted by scleroblasts, which lie in the trabeculae, and is made up of only one
  kind of spicule and its modifications. This is the hexactine, a spicule which possesses six rays
  disposed along three rectangular axes. Each ray contains an axial thread, which meets its fellow
  at the centre of the spicule, where they together form the axial cross. Modifications of the
  hexactine arise either by reduction or branching, by spinulation or expansion of one or more of
  the rays. The forms of spicule arising by reduction are termed pentactines, tetractines, and so
  on, according to the number of the remaining rays. Those rays which are suppressed leave the
  proximal portion of their axial thread as a remnant marking their former position (Fig. 94).
  Octactine spicules seem to form an exception to the above statements, but Schulze has shown that
  they too are but modifications of the hexactine arising by (1) branching of the rays of a
  hexactine, followed by (2) recombination of the secondary rays (Fig. 92).</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The deviations from this ground-plan of Hexactinellid structure are few and simple. They are
  due to folding of the chamber-layer, or to variations in the shape of the chambers, and to
  increasing fusion of the spicules to form rigid skeletons. A simple condition of the
  chamber-layer, like that of the young sponge of Fig. 89, <span class="pagenum" id="page202"><span
  class="smaller">{202}</span></span>occurs also in some adult Hexactinellids, <i>e.g.</i> in
  <i>Walteria</i> of the Pacific Ocean (Fig. 90). Thus is represented in this order the second type
  of canal system described among Calcarea. More frequently, however, instead of forming a smooth
  sheet, the chamber-layer grows out into a number of tubular diverticula, the cavities of which are
  excurrent canals; these determine a corresponding number of incurrent canals which lie between
  them. In this way there arises a canal system resembling the third type of Calcarea. By still
  further pouching so as to give secondary diverticula, opening into the first, a complicated canal
  system is formed, as, for example, in <i>Euplectella suberea</i>.</p>

  <p>To return to the skeleton, the most complete fusion is attained by the deposit of a continuous
  sheath of silica round the apposed parallel rays of neighbouring spicules. This may be termed the
  dictyonine type of union, for it occurs in all those forms originally included under the term
  Dictyonina, in which the cement is deposited <i>pari passu</i> with the formation of the spicules.
  In other cases connecting bridges of silica unite the spicules, or there may be a connecting
  reticulum of siliceous threads, or, again, rays crossing obliquely may be soldered together at the
  point of contact. These more irregular methods occur in species where the spicules are free at
  their first formation. Spicules originally free may later be united in a true Dictyonine fashion.
  The terms <span class="sc">Lyssacina</span> and <span class="sc">Dictyonina</span> are useful to
  denote respectively: the former all those Hexactinellida in which the spicules are free at their
  first formation, and the latter those in which the deposit of the cementing layer goes hand in
  hand with the formation of the spicules. But the terms do not indicate separateness of origin of
  the groups denoted by them, for there is evidence that Dictyonine types have been derived
  repeatedly from Lyssacine types, and that in fact every Dictyonine was once a Lyssacine.</p>

  <p>All the Amphidiscophora have Lyssacine skeletons; in the Hexasterophora both types of skeleton

  directed towards one end. This method of classification gives us a wholly Dictyonine order, <span

  <p><i>Hyalonema thomsoni</i>, one of the glass-rope sponges, was dredged by the <i>Porcupine</i>
  off the Shetland Islands in water of about 550 fathoms. The spindle-shaped body of the sponge is
  shown in Fig. 97. Its long rooting tuft is continued right up its axis, to end in a conical

  <p>The crust of Anthozoa of the genus <i>Epizoanthus</i> (p. <a href="#page406">406</a>) on the
  rooting tuft is a constant feature in this as in other species of <i>Hyalonema</i>. It contributed
  to make the sponge a puzzle, which long defied interpretation. The earliest diagnosis the genus
  received was the "Glass Plant." Then the root tuft was thought to be part of the
  <i>Epizoanthus</i>, which was termed a "most aberrant Alcyonarian with its base inserted in a
  sponge"; next we hear of the sponge as parasitic <span class="pagenum" id="page205"><span
  class="smaller">{205}</span></span>on the Sea Anemone. Finally, the root tuft was shown to be
  proper to the sponge, which was, however, figured upside down, till some Japanese collectors
  described the natural position, or that in which they were accustomed to find it.</p>

  <p><i>Pheronema carpenteri</i> was found by the <i>Lightning</i> off the north of Scotland in 530
  fathoms. The goblet shaped, thick walled body and broad, ill-defined root tuft are shown in Fig.
  98, but no figure can do justice to the lustre of its luxuriant prostalia and delicate dermal
  network with stellate knots at regular intervals. The basalia are two-pronged and anchor-like.</p>

  The upper end of the tube is closed by a sieve plate, the perforations in which are oscula, while
  the beams contain flagellated chambers, so that the sieve is simply a modified portion of the
  wall. It is a peculiarity of this as of one or two other allied genera that the lateral walls are
  perforated by oscula. They are termed parietal gaps, and are regularly arranged along spiral lines
  encircling the body.</p>

  <p>Ijima, who has dredged Euplectellids from the waters near Tokyo, finds that in young specimens
  oscula are confined to the sieve plate; parietal gaps are secondary formations. The groundwork of
  the skeleton is a lattice similar to that shown in Fig. 100. The chamber-layer is much folded.
  Various foreign species of <i>Euplectella</i> afford interesting examples of association with a

  id="NtA_237" href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> brings forward important arguments for retaining
  them among Hexactinellida. The only elements in the skeleton of the simpler genera, <i>e.g.</i>
  <i>Ischadites</i>, are structures comparable to Hexactinellid spicules. The surface of the fossil
  presents a series of lozenges forming a regular mosaic. Each lozenge is the expanded end of one of
  the rays of a spicule; it conceals four rays in one plane, tangential to the wall of the
  cup-shaped fossil, while the sixth ray projects vertically to the wall into the cavity of the cup.
  In the genus <i>Receptaculites</i> itself there is an inner layer of plates abutting against the
  inner <span class="pagenum" id="page208"><span class="smaller">{208}</span></span>ends of the
  sixth rays, and at present problematic. An axial canal is present in each of the rays&mdash;the
  six canals meeting at the centre of the spicule. Special chinks between the spicules appear to
  have provided a passage for the water current.</p>

  <p>The beautiful <i>Ventriculites</i>, so common in the Chalk and present in the Cambridge
  Greensand, are historically interesting, for the fact that they are fossil Hexactinellida of which
  the general and skeletal characters were very minutely described by Toulmin Smith long before
  recent representatives of the group were known. In common with a number of fossil Dictyonine
  species they are distinguished by the perforation of the nodes, a character due to the fact that
  the siliceous investment which unites the spicules together stops short before reaching the centre
  of each spicule, and bridges across the rays so as to form a skeleton octahedron. This character
  is rare in recent Hexactinellids, but, as first pointed out by Carter, it is presented by one or
  two forms, of which <i>Aulocystis grayi</i> Bwk is best known. The majority of the fossil
  Hexactinellida belong to the Dictyonine section, a fact attributable to the greater coherence of
  their skeleton. The "Dictyonina" are to be reckoned among the rock-builders of Jurassic and
  Cretaceous times.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <b>Octactinellida</b> and <b>Heteractinellida</b> are two classes created by
  Hinde<a id="NtA_238" href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> to contain certain little-known Devonian
  and Carboniferous sponges, possessing in the one case 8-rayed spicules, of which 6 rays lie in one
  plane and 2 are perpendicular to this plane; in the other case, spicules with a number of rays
  varying from 6 to 30. Bearing in mind the manner in which octactine spicules are known to arise in
  recent Hexactinellida (p. <a href="#page200">200</a>), it is clearly possible to derive these
  8-rayed spicules from hexactines by some similar method; while the typical <span class="pagenum"
  id="page209"><span class="smaller">{209}</span></span>spicule of the Heteractinellida is a
  euaster. Hence we may refer the Octactinellid fossils to the class Hexactinellida, and the
  Heteractinellid forms either to the Monaxonida or Tetractinellida.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS III. DEMOSPONGIAE</p>

  <p><i>Silicispongiae in which triaxonid spicules are absent.</i></p>

  <p>This class has attained the highest level of organisation known among Porifera; the most
  efficient current-producing apparatus is met with here, so, too, are protective coverings, stout
  coherent skeletons, and the highest degree of histological differentiation found in the
  phylum.</p>

  <p>Correspondingly it is the most successful group, the majority of existing sponges coming within
  its boundaries. A few genera and species are exceedingly specialised, for example, <i>Disyringa
  dissimilis</i> (p. <a href="#page215">215</a>). These, however, contribute only a very small
  contingent to the Demosponge population, those species which are really prolific and abundant
  being, as we should expect, the less exaggerated types.</p>

  <p><b>Canal System.</b>&mdash;With a few exceptions the representatives of the Demospongiae may be
  said to have taken up the evolution of the canal system at the stage where it was left in
  <i>Leucandra aspera</i>&mdash;a stage which the ancestral Demosponges must have reached quite
  independently of the Calcarea. These commoner members are thus already gifted with the advantages
  pertaining to a spherical form of ciliated chamber, and so, too, is the Rhagon (Fig. 105), an
  immature stage noteworthy as the simplest form of Demosponge, and thus the starting-point for the
  higher types of canal system. The exceptions above alluded to are not without interest: they are
  the Dendroceratina, of doubtful affinities, (p. <a href="#page220">220</a>), which possess small
  tubular Syconate chambers. They may be regarded either as of independent origin from other
  Demospongiae, thus making the group polyphyletic, or more simply as representing the ancestral
  condition, and in this case we must look on the possession of spherical chambers by the Rhagon as
  a secondary feature. Occupying as it does the important position above indicated, the Rhagon
  merits a brief description. It is a small discoid or hemispherical body attached by a flat base.
  It contains a central paragaster, with a single osculum at the free end. Into the paragaster open
  directly a <span class="pagenum" id="page210"><span class="smaller">{210}</span></span>few
  spherical flagellated chambers, which lie in the lateral walls of the body. The basal wall of the
  paragaster, the parts of its lateral walls between the openings of neighbouring chambers, and the
  entire outer surface of the body are covered with pinacocytes. It is convenient to call the basal
  part of the sponge from which chambers are absent the hypophare, the upper chamber-bearing part
  the spongophare. In some of the deeper dermal cells spicules may be already present. In the
  Rhagon, then, the canal system is of the second type, but all the adult Demosponges have advanced
  to the third type, and the further evolution in this system is in the direction of improving the
  mode of communication of the chambers with the canal system. The changes involved go hand in hand
  with increasing bulk of the dermal layer. A glance at the accompanying figures will show at once
  the connexion between the phenomena. The increase in the dermal layer (1) greatly reduces the
  extent of the lumen of the excurrent canals; and (2) results in the intervention of a narrow tube
  or aphodus between the mouth of each chamber and the excurrent canal. The chamber system is then
  converted from an "eurypylous" to an "aphodal" type. When the incurrent canal also opens into the
  chamber by way of narrow tubes, one proper to each chamber and termed "prosodus," the canal system
  is of the "diplodal" type.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Cortex.</b>&mdash;All the stages in the formation of a cortex are to be seen among the adult
  members of the group. Certain species (e.g. <i>Plakina monolopha</i>, F.E.S.) are destitute even
  of an ectosome, <span class="pagenum" id="page211"><span class="smaller">{211}</span></span>others
  have a simple dermal membrane (<i>Halichondria panicea</i>, <i>Tetilla pedifera</i>) and various
  others are provided with a cortex, either of simple structure or showing elaboration in one or
  more particulars. Thus a protective armature of special spicules may be present in the cortex,
  <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Geodia</i>, or to a less extent in <i>Tethya</i>, or there may be an abundance
  of contractile elements, and these may be arranged in very definite ways, forming valve-like
  apparatus that will respond to stimuli.</p>

  <p>Everywhere among sponges the goal of the skeleton appears to have been coherence. We have seen
  how in Calcarea and in Hexactinellida this has been attained by the secretion around the separate
  elements of a continuous mineral sheath, calcareous in the one case and siliceous in the other.
  Here we had an excellent instance of the attainment of one end by similar means in two different
  groups, after their separation from the common stock, and therefore independently. In
  Demospongiae, on the other hand, the same end&mdash;coherence&mdash;has been secured by two new
  methods, each distinct from the former: first the spicules may be united in strands by an organic
  deposit, spongin; secondly, the spicules may assume irregular shapes and interlock closely with
  one another, forming dense and stout skeletons. The latter method is that characteristic of the
  Lithistid Tetractinellida.</p>

  <p><b>Classification.</b>&mdash;It is not of great moment which scheme of classification we
  maintain, seeing that all hitherto proposed are confessedly more or less artificial, and
  sufficient data for framing a natural one are not yet forthcoming. For convenience, we accept
  three subdivisions and define them thus<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p>I. <span class="sc">Tetractinellida.</span>&mdash;Demospongiae possessing tetraxon or triaene
    spicules or Lithistid desmas.</p>
    <p>II. <span class="sc">Monaxonida.</span>&mdash;Demospongiae possessing monaxon but not
    tetraxon spicules.</p>
    <p class="sp0">III. <span class="sc">Ceratosa.</span>&mdash;Demospongiae in which the main
    skeleton is formed of fibres of spongin. The fibres may have a core of sand-grains or of foreign
    spicules, but not of spicules proper to the sponge.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">But at the same time we admit that some of the Ceratosa are probably descended from
  some of the families of Monaxonida, so that we should perhaps be justified in separating these
  families of Monaxonida from the rest, and associating them with the allied families of
  Ceratosa&mdash;a method of classification due to <span class="pagenum" id="page212"><span
  class="smaller">{212}</span></span>Vosmaer. Again, some Monaxonida approximate to Tetractinellida,
  and we might, with Vosmaer, unite them under the title Spiculispongiae. This proceeding, though it
  has the advantage of being at least an attempt to secure a natural classification, involves too
  much assumption when carried out in detail to be wholly satisfactory.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Class I. Tetractinellida.</b><a id="NtA_239"
  href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Tetractinellida appear to flourish best in moderate depths from 50 to 200 fathoms, but they are
  found to be fairly abundant also in shallower water right up to the coast line, and in deep water
  up to and beyond the 1000 fathom line. Occasionally they lie free on the bottom, but are far more
  commonly attached; fixation may be direct or by means of rooting spicules; the occurrence of a
  stalk is rare. There is great variety in the root tuft, which may be a long loose wisp of
  grapnel-headed spicules, as in many species of <i>Tetilla</i>, or a massive tangle, as in
  <i>Cinachyra barbata</i>; in these cases the sponge is merely anchored, so that it rests at the
  level of the surface of the ooze; in other cases, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Thenea wyvillei</i>, the root
  tuft consists of a number of pillars of spicules which raise the sponge above the level of the
  ooze, into which they descend and there become continuous with a large dense and confused mass of
  spicules. The parachute-like base of <i>Tetilla casula</i> invites comparison with the
  "Crinorhiza" forms of some Monaxonids (p. <a href="#page216">216</a>).</p>

  <p>Two Orders are distinguished thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp3">
    <p>I. <span class="sc">Choristida.</span>&mdash;Tetractinellida with quadriradiate spicules,
    which are never articulated together into a rigid network.</p>
    <p class="sp0">II. <span class="sc">Lithistida.</span>&mdash;Tetractinellida with branching
    scleres (desmas), which may or may not be modified tetrad spicules, articulated together to form
    a rigid network. Triaene spicules may or may not be present in addition.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Choristida.</b></p>

  <p><i>Plakina monolopha</i>, from the Adriatic and Mediterranean, furnishes a connecting link
  between the Rhagon stage and other Tetractinellida. The choanosome is simply folded; there is no
  distinct ectosome; the chambers are eurypylous. The skeleton <span class="pagenum"
  id="page213"><span class="smaller">{213}</span></span>consists of microcalthrops and their
  derivatives. The hypophare is well developed. <i>Plakina</i> thus shows a certain amount of
  resemblance to <i>Oscarella</i> (p. <a href="#page196">196</a>), with which it shares the very
  remarkable possession of flagellated pinacocytes.</p>

  <p>One of the species of <i>Tetilla, T. pedifera</i>, continues the series. The folds of its
  choanosome are more complicated than in <i>P. monolopha</i>, and their outer ends are bridged
  together by a thin layer of ectosome (cf. species of <i>Sycon</i> among Calcarea); the chambers
  are still eurypylous.</p>

  <p>The skeleton reaches a high level: it includes oxeas and triaenes radiately disposed and
  microscleres (sigmata) scattered throughout the dermal layer. The British <i>Poecillastra
  compressa</i> from the north of Scotland and Orkney and Shetland is at about the same stage of
  development, being without cortex and having eurypylous chambers, but it is not so good an
  example, as the folds of its choanosome are confused.</p>

  <p>From <i>T. pedifera</i> we pass to the other species of <i>Tetilla</i> and all the higher
  genera of Choristida; these possess a cortex not of homologous origin in the various cases, but
  probably to be classified under one of two heads, typified by <i>Stelletta</i> and
  <i>Craniella</i> respectively (Fig. 106).</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page214"><span class="smaller">{214}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the Stellettids the cortex arises by the centrifugal growth of a dermal membrane such as
  that of <i>Tetilla pedifera</i>; in <i>Craniella</i> directly from the dermal tissue of the distal
  ends of the choanosomal folds.</p>

  <p>In both cases the end result, after completion of cell differentiation, is a cortex either
  fibrous throughout or collenchymatous in its outer portion and fibrous in the deeper layers. In
  the Stellettid type the centrifugal growth of the dermal membrane involves the addition of
  secondary distal portions to the ends of the inhalant passages. These are the intercortical
  cavities or canals. Their most specialised form is the "chone." A chone is a passage through the
  cortex opening to the exterior by one or more ostia, and communicating with the deeper parts of
  the inhalant system by a single aperture provided with a sphincter (Fig. 106, B).</p>

  <p>In the <i>Craniella</i> type the intercortical cavities are parts of the primary inhalant
  system. They communicate with its deeper parts by sphinctrate apertures. Without any knowledge of
  the development one would certainly have supposed that the subdermal cavity, pore-sieve and
  sphinctrate passages of <i>Craniella</i> represented a number of chones, of which the outer
  portions had become fused (Fig. 106, A).</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In both <i>Craniella</i> and <i>Stelletta</i> the chamber system is aphodal, and these genera
  may fairly be taken as representatives of the average level reached by Tetractinellida. The
  skeleton is of the radiate type: the type which prevails in the Choristida, but which has an
  erratic distribution, appearing in some genera of <span class="pagenum" id="page215"><span
  class="smaller">{215}</span></span>each family but not in others. The genus <i>Pachymatisma</i>,
  of which we have the species <i>P. johnstonia</i> and <i>P. normani</i> in these islands,
  exemplifies this; it belongs to the highly differentiated family Geodiidae, possesses an elaborate
  cortex with chones, but its main skeleton is non-radiate.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Disyringa dissimilis</i> is remarkable for the perfection of its symmetry, and
  for the absence of that multiplication of parts which is so common among sponges. It possesses a
  single inhalant tube and a single osculum (Fig. 107). Until quite recently it stood alone in the
  restriction of its inhalant apertures to a single area. Kirkpatrick, however, has now described a
  sponge&mdash;<i>Spongocardium gilchristi</i><a id="NtA_240"
  href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a>&mdash;from Cape Colony, in which the dermal ostia are
  concentrated in one sieve-like patch at the opposite pole to the single osculum. <i>Disyringa</i>
  is still without companions in the possession of an inhalant tube. The concentration of ostia into
  sieve areas occurs again in <i>Cinachyra</i>, each sponge possessing in this case several inhalant
  areas with or without scattered ostia also.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Lithistida.</b></p>

  <p>The characteristic spicule of Lithistida&mdash;the desma&mdash;may be a modified calthrop
  (tetracrepid desma), or it may be produced by the growth of silica over a uniaxial spicule
  (rhabdocrepid desma) (Fig. 110, <i>q</i>), or it may be of the polyaxon type. It is probable that
  the group is polyphyletic,<a id="NtA_241" href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> and that some of its
  members should remain associated with Tetractinellida, while others should be removed to
  Monaxonida. Forms with tetracrepid desmas, and those forms with rhabdocrepid desmas which possess
  triaenes, have Tetractinellid affinities, while forms possessing rhabdocrepid desmas but lacking
  triaenes, and again those in which the desmas are polyaxon, are probably descendants of
  Monaxonida.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Owing to the consistency of the skeleton Lithistida are frequently found as
  fossils. The commonest known example is <i>Siphonia</i>.<a id="NtA_242"
  href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> As in the case of so many other fossil sponges the skeleton is
  often replaced by carbonate of lime, a fact which <span class="pagenum" id="page216"><span
  class="smaller">{216}</span></span>misled some of the earlier investigators but was established by
  the researches of Sollas and Zittel.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Class II. Monaxonida.</b><a id="NtA_243"
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Monaxonida inhabit for the most part shallow water, but they also extend through deep water
  into the abysses, thirteen species having been dredged from depths of over 2000 fathoms by the
  "Challenger" Expedition alone. In some cases, e.g. <i>Cladorhiza</i>, <i>Chondrocladia</i>, all
  the species of a genus may live in deep water, while in others the genus, or in others, again, the
  species, may have a wide bathymetrical range. Thus <i>Axinella</i> spp. occur in shallow water and
  in various depths down to 2385 fathoms, <i>Axinella erecta</i> ranges from 90 to 1600 fathoms,
  <i>Stylocordyla stipitata</i> from 7 to 1600, and so on. The symmetry of the deep-water forms
  contrasts strikingly with the more irregular shape of their shallow-water allies.<a id="NtA_244"
  href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> The shallow-water species are almost always directly attached,
  some few are stalked; those from deep water have either a long stalk or some special device to
  save them from sinking in the soft ooze or mud. Thus the deep-sea genus <i>Trichostemma</i> has
  the form of a low inverted cone, round the base of which a long marginal fringe of spicules
  projects, continuing the direction of the somal spicules, and so forming a supporting rim. The
  same form has been independently evolved in <i>Halicnemia patera</i>, and an approach to it in
  <i>Xenospongia patelliformis</i>. A similar and more striking case of homoplasy is afforded by the
  Crinorhiza form, which has been attained in certain species of the deep-sea genera
  <i>Chondrocladia</i>, <i>Axoniderma</i>, and <i>Cladorhiza</i>; here the sub-globular body is
  supported by a vertical axis or root, and by a whorl of stout processes radiating outwards and
  downwards from it, and formed of spicular bundles together with some soft tissue.</p>

  <p class="sp3">There is recognisable in the order Monaxonida a cleft between one set of genera,
  typically corticate, and suggesting by their structure a relationship, whether of descent or
  parentage, with the Tetractinellida, and a second set typically non-corticate: these latter are
  the Halichondrina, the former are the Spintharophora.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page217"><span class="smaller">{217}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Halichondrina.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">We have already seen typical examples of the Halichondrina in <i>Halichondria
  panicea</i> and <i>Ephydatia fluviatilis</i>. Within the Halichondrina the development of spongin
  reaches its maximum among spiculiferous sponges, and accordingly the Ceratosa take their multiple
  origin here (p. <a href="#page220">220</a>). Among Halichondrina spongin co-operates with spicules
  to form a skeleton in various ways, but always so as to leave some spicules bare or free in the
  flesh. It may bind the spicules end to end in delicate networks (as in <i>Reniera</i> or
  <i>Gellius</i>), or into strands, sometimes reaching a considerable thickness (as in
  <i>Chalina</i> and others). In a few cases there appears to be a kind of division of labour
  between the spicules and spongin, the latter forming the bulk of the fibre, <i>i.e.</i> fulfilling
  the functions of support, while the spicules merely beset its surface as defensive organs,
  rendering the sponge unfit for food. Fibres formed on this pattern are called plumose, and are
  typical of Axinellidae. The distinctive fibre of the Ectyoninae is as it were a combination of the
  Axinellid and Chalinine types: a horny fibre both cored with spicules and beset with them.
  Spicules besetting the surface of a fibre are termed "echinating." Whenever its origin has been
  investigated, spongin has proved to be the product of secretion of cells; in the great majority of
  cases it is poured out at the surface of the cell, and Evans showed,<a id="NtA_245"
  href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a> at any rate in one species of <i>Spongilla</i>, that the
  spongin fibres are continuous with a delicate cuticle at the surface of the sponge. In
  <i>Reniera</i> spp. occurs a curious case of formation of spongin as an intracellular secretion. A
  number of spherical cells each secrete within themselves a short length of fibre; they then place
  themselves in rows, so orientated that their contained rods lie end to end in one line. The rods
  then fuse and make up continuous threads; the cells diminish in breadth, ultimately leaving the
  fibre free.<a id="NtA_246" href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Spintharophora.</b></p>

  <p>These corticate forms are further characterised by the arrangement of their megascleres, which
  is usually, like that of most <span class="pagenum" id="page218"><span
  class="smaller">{218}</span></span>Tetractinellida, radial, or approximating to radial. The
  microscleres are, when present, some form of aster. The cortex resembles that of Tetractinellida,
  and v. Lendenfeld has described chones in <i>Tethya lyncurium</i>.<a id="NtA_247"
  href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The existence of the above points of resemblance between Spintharophora and Tetractinellida
  suggests a relationship between the two groups as its cause. In judging this possibility the
  following reflections occur to us. A cortex exists in various independent branches of
  Tetractinellida. It has in all probability had a different phylogenetic history in each&mdash;why
  not then in these Monaxonida also? Within single genera of Tetractinellida some species are
  corticate, others not, witness <i>Tetilla</i>. The value of a cortex for purposes of
  classification may easily be overestimated. If we are to uphold the relationship between these two
  groups, we must base our argument on the conjunction of similar characters in each.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Proteleia</i><a id="NtA_248" href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> is interesting
  for its slender grapnel-like spicules, which project beyond the radially disposed cortical
  spicules, and simulate true anatriaenes of minute proportions. That they are not anatriaenes is
  shown by the absence of an axial thread in their cladi. It is not surprising that a form of
  spicule of such obvious utility as the anatriaene should arise more than once.</p>

  <p>Of exceptional interest, on account of their boring habit, are the Clionidae. How the process
  of boring is effected is not known; the presence of an acid in the tissues was suspected, but has
  been searched for in vain. The pieces of hard substance removed by the activity of the sponge take
  their exit through the osculum and have a fixed shape<a id="NtA_249"
  href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> (Fig. 108).</p>

  <p>As borers into oyster shells, Clionidae may be reckoned as pests of practical importance, and
  in some coasts they even devastate the rocks, penetrating to a depth of some feet, and causing

  <p>Sponges, however, as agents in altering the face of the earth do not figure as destroyers
  merely. On the contrary, it has <span class="pagenum" id="page219"><span
  class="smaller">{219}</span></span>been calculated<a id="NtA_251"
  href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a> that sponge skeletons may give rise with considerable rapidity
  to beds of flint nodules; in fact, it appears that a period so short as fifty years is sufficient
  for the formation of a bed of flints out of the skeletons of sponges alone.</p>

  <p><i>Suberites domuncula</i> is well known for its constant symbiosis with the Hermit crab. The
  young sponge settles on a Whelk or other shell inhabited by a <i>Pagurus</i>, and gradually
  envelops it, becoming very massive, and completely concealing the shell, without however closing
  its mouth. The aperture of this always remains open to the exterior, however great the growth of
  the sponge, a tubular passage being left in front of it, which continues the lumen of the shell
  and maintains its spiral direction. When the crab has grown too big for the shell, it merely
  advances a little down this passage. The shell is never absorbed, as was once supposed.<a
  id="NtA_252" href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> The crab, besides being provided with a
  continually growing house, and being thus spared the great dangers attending a shift of lodgings,
  benefits continually by the concealment and protection afforded by the massive sponge; the latter
  in return is conveyed to new places by the crab.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Ficulina ficus</i> is sometimes, like <i>S. domuncula</i>, found in symbiosis

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Class III. Ceratosa.</b></p>

  <p>The Ceratosa are an assemblage of ultimate twigs shorn from the branches of the Monaxonid tree.
  They are therefore related forms, but many of them are more closely connected with their Monaxonid
  relatives than with their associates in their own sub-class.</p>

  <p>The genera <i>Aulena</i> and <i>Phoriospongia</i>, placed by v. Lendenfeld among Ceratosa, by
  Minchin among Monaxonida, show each in its own way how close is the link between these two
  sub-classes.</p>

  <p><i>Aulena</i> possesses in its deeper parts a skeleton of areniferous spongin fibres, in fact a
  typical Ceratose skeleton; but this is continuous with a skeleton in the more superficial parts,
  which is composed of spongin fibres echinated by spicules proper to the sponge, and precisely
  comparable to the ectyonine fibres of some Monaxonida.</p>

  <p><i>Phoriospongia</i>, as far as its main skeleton is concerned, is a typical Ceratose sponge,
  with fibres of the areniferous type, but it possesses sigmata free in the flesh.</p>

  <p>The sub-class is confined to shallow water, no horny sponge having been dredged from depths
  greater than 410 fathoms.<a id="NtA_253" href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> The greatest number
  occur at depths between 10 and 26 fathoms.</p>

  <p>In the majority of the Ceratosa the skeletal fibres are homogeneous, formed of concentric
  lamellae of spongin, deposited by a sheath of spongoblasts around a filiform axis. In others,
  however, the axis attains a considerable diameter, so as to form a kind of pith to the fibre,
  which is then distinguished as heterogeneous. In one or two cases some of the spongoblasts of a
  heterogeneous fibre are included in the fibre between the spongin lamellae. <i>Ianthella</i> is
  the best-known example in which this occurs.</p>

  <p>Ceratosa are divided into Dictyoceratina and Dendroceratina, distinguished, as their names
  express, by the nature of the skeleton&mdash;net-like, with many anastomoses, in the one;
  tree-like, without anastomoses between its branches, in the other.</p>

  <p>The Dictyoceratina comprise by far the larger number of Ceratosa. They fall into two main
  families, the Spongidae and Spongelidae, both represented in British waters. The Spongidae <span
  class="pagenum" id="page221"><span class="smaller">{221}</span></span>are characterised by a
  granular ground substance and aphodal chamber system; the Spongelidae by a clear ground substance
  and sac-like eurypylous chambers.</p>

  <p>The bath sponge, <i>Euspongia officinalis</i>, belongs to the Spongidae. The finest varieties
  come from the Adriatic, the coarser ones from the Dalmatian and North African coasts of the
  Mediterranean, from the Grecian Archipelago, from the West Indies, and from Australian seas. The
  softer species of the genus <i>Hippospongia</i> also form a source of somewhat inferior bath
  sponges.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Among Dendroceratina, <i>Darwinella</i> is unique and tempts to speculation, in
  that it possesses isolated spongin elements, resembling in their forms triaxon spicules.</p>

  <p>The reproductive processes of Sponges are of such great importance in leading us to a true
  conception of the nature of a sponge that we propose to treat them here in a special section. Both
  sexual and asexual methods are common; the multiplication of oscula we do not regard as an act of
  reproduction (p. <a href="#page174">174</a>).</p>

  <p>A cursory glance at a collection of sponge <b>larvae</b> from different groups would suggest
  the conclusion that they are divisible into two wholly distinct types. One of these is the
  <i>amphiblastula</i>, and the other the <i>parenchymula</i>. This was the conclusion accepted by
  zoologists not long ago. We are indebted to Delage, Maas, and Minchin for dispelling it, and
  showing that <span class="pagenum" id="page227"><span class="smaller">{227}</span></span>these
  types are but the extreme terms of a continuous series of forms which have all the same essential
  constitution and undergo the same metamorphosis.</p>

  <p>The amphiblastula of <i>Sycon raphanus</i> (Fig. 111) consists of an anterior half, formed of
  slender flagellated cells, and a posterior half, of which the cells are large, non-flagellate, and
  rounded. These two kinds of cell are arranged around a small internal cavity which is largely
  filled up with amoebocytes. The flagellated cells are invaginated into the dome of rounded cells
  during metamorphosis, in fact, become the choanocytes or gastral cells; the rounded cells, on the
  other hand, become the dermal cells&mdash;an astonishing fact to any one acquainted only with
  Metazoan larvae.</p>

  <p>A typical parenchymula is that of <i>Clathrina blanca</i> (Fig. 112). When hatched it consists
  of a wall surrounding a large central cavity and built up of flagellated cells interrupted at the
  hinder pole by two cells (<i>p.g.c</i>)&mdash;the mother-cells of archaeocytes. Before the
  metamorphosis, certain of the flagellated cells leave the wall and sink into the central cavity,
  and undergoing certain changes establish an inner mass of future dermal cells. By subsequent
  metamorphosis the remaining flagellated cells become internal, not this time by invagination, but
  by the included dermal cells breaking through the wall of the larva, and forming themselves into a
  layer at the outside.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the larva of <i>C. blanca</i>, after a period of free-swimming existence, the same three
  elements are thus recognisable as in that of <i>Sycon</i> at the time of hatching; in the newly
  hatched larva of <i>C. blanca</i>, however, one set of elements, the dermal cells, are not
  distinguishable. The difference, then, between the two newly hatched larvae is due to the earlier
  cell differentiation of the <i>Sycon</i> larva.<a id="NtA_254"
  href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Now consider the larva of <i>Leucosolenia</i>. It is hatched as a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page228"><span class="smaller">{228}</span></span>completely flagellated larva; its
  archaeocytes are internal (as in <i>Sycon</i>); future dermal cells, recognisable as such, are
  absent. They arise, as in <i>C. blanca</i>, by transformation of flagellated cells; but (1) this
  process is confined to the posterior pole, and (2) the internal cavity is small and filled up with
  archaeocytes. Consequently the cells which have lost their flagella and become converted into
  dermal cells cannot sink in as in <i>C. blanca</i>: they accumulate at the hinder pole, and thus
  arises a larva half flagellated, half not; in fact, an amphiblastula. Or, briefly, in
  <i>Leucosolenia</i> the larva at hatching is a parenchymula, and when ready to fix is an
  amphiblastula; and, again, the difference between the newly hatched larva and that of <i>Sycon</i>
  is due to the earlier occurrence of cell differentiation in the latter. What completer
  transitional series could be desired?</p>

  <p>Turning to the Micromastictora, the developmental history already sketched is fairly typical
  (p. <a href="#page172">172</a>). The differences between Mega- and Micro-mastictoran larvae are
  referable mainly to the fact that the dermal cells in the latter become at once differentiated
  among themselves to form the main types of dermal cell of the adult.<a id="NtA_255"
  href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> The metamorphosis is comparable to that of <i>C. blanca</i>.
  Among Tetractinellida and Hexactinellida sexually produced larvae have not been certainly
  identified.</p>

  <p>Asexual reproduction takes place according to one of three types, which may be alluded to as
  (1) "budding," (2) "gemmulation," (3) formation of "asexual larvae."</p>

  <p>By <b>budding</b> (Fig. 113) is meant the formation of reproductive bodies, each of which
  contains differentiated elements of the various classes found in the parent. A simple example of
  this is described by Miklucho Maclay in Ascons, where the bud is merely the end of one of the
  Ascon tubes which becomes pinched off and so set free.</p>

  <p>In <i>Leucosolenia botryoides</i><a id="NtA_256" href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> Vasseur
  describes a similar process; in this, however, a strikingly distinctive feature is present (Fig.
  114), namely, the buds have an inverse orientation with respect to that of the parent, so that the
  budding sponge presents a contrast to a sponge in which multiplication of oscula has occurred. In
  fact, the free distal end of the bud becomes the base of the young sponge, and the osculum is
  formed at the opposite extremity, where the bud is constricted from the parent.</p>

      extremity which was free or distal in <b>A</b>. (After Vasseur.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Such a reversal of the position of the bud is noteworthy in view of its rarity, and the case is
  worth reinvestigating, for in other animal groups a bud or a regenerated part retains so
  constantly the same orientation as the parent that Loeb,<a id="NtA_257"
  href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> after experimenting on the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page230"><span class="smaller">{230}</span></span>regeneration of Coelenterata and other
  forms, concluded that a kind of "polarity" existed in the tissues of certain animals.</p>

  <p>In <i>Oscarella lobularis</i><a id="NtA_258" href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a> the buds are
  transparent floating bladders, derived from little prominences on the surface of the sponge.
  Scattered in the walls of the bladders are flagellated chambers, which open into the central
  cavity. The vesicular nature of the buds is doubtless an adaptation, lessening their specific
  gravity and so enabling them to float to a distance from the parent.</p>

  <p><b>Gemmulation.</b>&mdash;<i>Spongilla</i> has already afforded us a typical example of this
  process. Gemmules very similar to those of <i>Spongilla</i> are known in a few marine sponges,
  especially in <i>Suberites</i> and in <i>Ficulina</i>. They form a layer attached to the surface
  of support of the sponge&mdash;a layer which may be single or double, or even three or four tiers
  deep. A micropyle is sometimes present in the spongin coat, sometimes absent; possibly its absence
  may be correlated with the piling of one layer of gemmules on another, as this, by covering up the
  micropyle, would of course render it useless. Presumably when a micropyle is present the living
  contents escape through it and leave the sponge by way of the canal system (Fig. 115).</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The only case besides <i>Spongilla</i> in which the details of development from gemmules have
  been traced is that of <i>Tethya</i>.<a id="NtA_259" href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> Mere
  microscopic examination of a <i>Tethya</i> in active reproduction would suggest that the process
  was simple budding, but Maas has shown that the offspring arise from groups of archaeocytes in the
  cortex, that is to say, they are typical gemmules. As they develop they migrate outwards along the
  radial spicule-bundles <span class="pagenum" id="page231"><span
  class="smaller">{231}</span></span>and are finally freed, like the buds of the Hexactinellid
  <i>Lophocalyx</i> (Fig. 113).</p>

  <p>The comparison of the process of development on the one hand by gemmules, and on the other by
  larval development, is of some interest.<a id="NtA_260" href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a> In
  both cases two cell layers&mdash;a dermal and a gastral&mdash;are established before the young
  sponge has reached a functional state. Differences of detail in the formation of the chambers
  occur in the gemmule; these find parallels in the differences in the same process exhibited by the
  larvae of various groups of sponges. On the other hand, the order of tissue differentiation is not
  the same in the gemmule as in the larva.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In Hexactinellida the place of sexually produced larvae is taken by bodies of similar origin to
  gemmules but with the appearance of parenchymulae. Ijima has indeed seen a few egg-cells in
  Hexactinellids.<a id="NtA_261" href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> He finds, however, that
  archaeocyte congeries occur in abundance, and there is good reason to believe with him that these
  are responsible for the numerous parenchymula-like <b>asexually produced larvae</b> he has
  observed. The discovery of "asexual larvae" was first made by Wilson in the Monaxonid
  <i>Esperella</i>; in this case the asexual larva is, as far as can be detected, identical with
  that developed from the fertilised egg. A similar phenomenon, the production <span class="pagenum"
  id="page232"><span class="smaller">{232}</span></span>of apparently identical larvae by both
  sexual and asexual methods, has been observed in the Coelenterate <i>Gonionema murbachii</i>.<a
  id="NtA_262" href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Artificially, sponges may be reproduced with great advantage to commerce by means of cuttings.
  Cuttings of the bath sponge are fit to gather after a seven years' growth.</p>

  <p>The development of the various forms of <b>spicules</b> is a subject about which little is yet
  known. Most spicules of which the development has been traced originate in a single dermal cell.
  The triradiate and quadriradiate spicules of Homocoela (Clathrinidae), as Minchin<a id="NtA_263"
  href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a> has most beautifully shown, form an exception. Three cells
  co-operate to form the triradiate; these three divide to give six before the growth of the spicule
  is complete. A quadriradiate is formed from a triradiate spicule by addition of the fourth ray,
  which, again, has a separate origin in an independent cell, in fact a porocyte. The triradiate
  spicules of the Sycettidae, on the other hand, originate in a single cell,<a id="NtA_264"
  href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> but the quadriradiate spicules are formed from these by the
  addition of a fourth ray in a manner similar to that which has just been described for
  Clathrinidae.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><span class="sc">Physiology</span></p>

  <p><b>Production of the Current.</b>&mdash;It is not at first sight obvious that the lashing of
  flagella in chambers arranged as above <span class="pagenum" id="page235"><span
  class="smaller">{235}</span></span>described, between an inhalant and an exhalant system of
  canals, will necessarily produce a current passing inwards at the ostia and outwards at the
  osculum. And the difficulty seems to be increased when it is found<a id="NtA_273"
  href="#Nt_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a> that the flagella in any one chamber do not vibrate in
  concert, but that each keeps its own time. This, however, is of less consequence than might seem
  to be the case. Two conditions are essential to produce the observed results: (1) in order that
  the water should escape at the mouth of the chamber there must be a pressure within the chamber
  higher than that in the exhalant passages; (2) in order that water may enter the chamber there
  must be within it a pressure less than that in the inhalant passages. But the pressure in the
  inhalant and exhalant passages is presumably the same, at any rate before the current is started,
  therefore there must be a difference of pressure within the chamber itself, and the less pressure
  must be round the periphery. Such a distribution of pressures would be set up if each flagellum
  caused a flow of water directed away from its own cell and towards the centre of the chamber; and
  this would be true whether the flagellum beats synchronously with its fellows or not.</p>

  <p>The comparative study of the canal systems of sponges<a id="NtA_274"
  href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a> acquires a greater interest in proportion as the hope of
  correlating modifications with increase of efficiency seems to be realised. In a few main issues
  this hope may be said to have been realised. The points, so to speak, of a good canal system are
  (1) high oscular velocity, which ensures rapid removal of waste products to a wholesome distance;
  (2) a slow current without eddies in the flagellated chambers, to allow of the choanocytes picking
  up food particles (see below), and moreover to prevent injury to the delicate collars of those
  cells; (3) a small area of choanocytes, and consequent small expenditure of energy in current
  production.</p>

  <p>It is then at once clear at what a disadvantage the Ascons are placed as compared with other
  sponges having canal systems of the second or third types. Their chamber and oscular currents can
  differ but slightly, the difference being obtained merely by narrowing the lumen of the distal
  extremity of the body to form the oscular rim. Further, the choanocytes are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page236"><span class="smaller">{236}</span></span>acting on a volume of water which they can
  only imperfectly control, and it is no doubt due to the necessity of limiting the volume of water
  which the choanocytes have to set in motion that the members of the Ascon family are so restricted
  in size. The oscular rim is only a special case of a device adopted by sponges at the very outset
  of their career, and retained and perfected when they have reached their greatest heights; the
  volume of water passing per second over every cross-section of the path of the current is of
  course the same, therefore by narrowing the cross-sectional area of the path at any point, the
  velocity of the current is proportionally increased at that point. The lining of the oscular rim
  is of pinacocytes; they determine a smooth surface, offering little frictional resistance to the
  current, while choanocytes in the same position would have been a hindrance, not only by setting
  up friction, but by causing irregularities in the motion.</p>

  <p>Canal systems of the second type show a double advance upon that of the Ascons, namely,
  subdivision of the gastral cavity and much greater length of the smooth walled exhalant passage.
  The choanocytes have now a task more equal to their strength, and, further, there is now a very
  great inequality between the total sectional areas of the flagellated chambers and that of the
  oscular tube.</p>

  <p>Canal systems of the third type with tubular chambers are an improvement on those of the
  second, in that the area of choanocytes is increased by the pouching of the chamber-layer without
  corresponding increase in the size of the sponge. However, the area of choanocytes represents
  expenditure of energy, and the next problem to be solved is how to retain the improved current and
  at the same time to cut down expense. The first step is to change the form of the chamber from
  tubular to spherical. Now the energy of all the choanocytes is concentrated on the same small
  volume of water. The area of choanocytes is less, but the end result is as good as before. At the
  wide mouth of the spherical chamber there is nevertheless still a cause of loss of energy in the
  form of eddies, and it is as an obviation of these that one must regard the aphodi and prosodi
  with which higher members of the Demospongiae are provided. The correctness of this view receives
  support, apart from mechanical principles, from the fact that the mass of the body of any one of
  these sponges is greater relatively to the total flagellated area than in those sponges with
  eurypylous chambers; that is to say, a few <span class="pagenum" id="page237"><span
  class="smaller">{237}</span></span>aphodal and diplodal chambers are as efficient as many of the
  eurypylous type.</p>

  <p>It is manifest that the current is the bearer of the supply of <b>food</b>; but it requires
  more care to discover (1) what is the nature of the food; (2) by which of the cells bathed by the
  current the food is captured and by which digested. The answer to the latter question has long
  been sought by experimenters,<a id="NtA_275" href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a> who supplied the
  living sponge with finely powdered coloured matters, such as carmine, indigo, charcoal, suspended
  in water. The results received conflicting interpretations until it became recognised that it was
  essential to take into account the length of time during which the sponge had been fed before its
  tissues were subjected to microscopic examination. Vosmaer and Pekelharing obtained the following
  facts: <i>Spongilla lacustris</i> and <i>Sycon ciliatum</i>, when killed after feeding for from
  half an hour to two hours with milk or carmine, contain these substances in abundance in the
  bodies of the choanocytes and to a slight degree in the deeper cells of the dermal tissue; after
  feeding for twenty-four hours the proportions are reversed, and if a period of existence in water
  uncharged with carmine intervenes between the long feed and death then the chambers are completely
  free from carmine. These are perhaps the most conclusive experiments yet described, and they show
  that the choanocytes ingest solid particles and that the amoeboid cells of the dermal layer
  receive the ingested matter from them. In all probability it is fair to argue from these facts
  that solid particles of matter suitable to form food for the sponge are similarly dealt with by it
  and undergo digestion in the dermal cells.</p>

  <p>Choanocytes are the feeding organs <i>par excellence</i>; but the pinacocytes perform a small
  share of the function of ingestion, and in the higher sponges where the dermal tissue has acquired
  a great bulk the share is perhaps increased.</p>

  <p>In the above experiments is implied the tacit assumption that sponges take their food in the
  form of finely divided solids. Haeckel<a id="NtA_276" href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a> states
  his opinion that they feed on solid particles derived from decaying organisms, but that possibly
  decaying substances in solution may eke out their diet. Loisel, in 1898,<a id="NtA_277"
  href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum" id="page238"><span
  class="smaller">{238}</span></span>made a new departure in the field of experiment by feeding
  sponges with coloured solutions, and obtained valuable results. Thus solutions, if presented to
  the sponge in a state of extreme dilution, are subjected to choice, some being absorbed, some
  rejected. When absorbed they are accumulated in vacuoles within both dermal and gastral cells,
  mixed solutions are separated into their constituents and collected into separate vacuoles. In the
  vacuoles the solutions may undergo change; Congo red becomes violet, the colour which it assumes
  when treated with acid, and similarly blue litmus turns red. The contents of the vacuoles,
  sometimes modified, sometimes not, are poured out into the intercellular gelatinous matrix of the
  dermal layer, whence they are removed partly by amoeboid cells, partly, so Loisel thinks, by the
  action of the matrix itself. It adds to the value of these observations to learn that Loisel kept
  a <i>Spongilla</i> supplied with filtered spring-water, to which was added the filtered juice
  obtained from another crushed sponge. This <i>Spongilla</i> lived and budded, and was in good
  health at the end of ten days.</p>

  <p><b>Movement.</b>&mdash;Sponges are capable of locomotion only in the young stage; in the adult
  the only signs of movement are the exhalant current, and in some cases movements of contraction
  sufficiently marked to be visible to the naked eye. Meresjkowsky was one of the early observers of
  these movements. He mentions that he stimulated a certain corticate Monaxonid sponge by means of a
  needle point: a definite response to each prick inside the oscular rim was given by the speedy
  contraction of the osculum.<a id="NtA_278" href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Pigments and Spicules.</b>&mdash;Various reasons lead one to conclude that the spicules have
  some function other than that of support and defence, probably connected with metabolism.  For the
  spicules are cast off, sometimes in large numbers, to be replaced rapidly by new ones, a process
  for which it is difficult to find an adequate explanation if the spicules are regarded as merely
  skeletal and defensive.<a id="NtA_279" href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a> Potts remarks upon the
  striking profusion with which spicules are secreted by developing Spongillids from water in which
  the percentage of silica present must have been exceedingly small. The young sponges climbed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page239"><span class="smaller">{239}</span></span>up the strands of spicules
  as they formed them, leaving the lower parts behind and adding to the upper ends.</p>

  <p>Of the physiology of the pigments of sponges not much is yet known: a useful summary of facts
  will be found in Von F&uuml;rth's text-book.<a id="NtA_280" href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Spongin.</b>&mdash;Von F&uuml;rth<a href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a> points out that this term
  is really a collective one, seeing that the identity of the organic skeletal substance of all
  sponge species is hardly to be assumed. Spongin is remarkable for containing iodine. The amount of
  iodine present in different sponges varies widely, reaching in certain tropical species of the
  Aplysinidae and Spongidae the high figure 8 to 14 per cent. Seaweeds which are specially rich in
  iodine contain only 1.5 to 1.6 per cent.</p>

  <p>In view of the fact that iodine is a specific for croup, it is of interest to observe that the
  old herb doctors for many centuries recognised the bath sponge as a cure for that disease.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Distribution in Space.</b>&mdash;All the larger groups of Sponges are cosmopolitan. Each
  group has, however, its characteristic bathymetrical range: the facts are best displayed by means
  of curves, as in Fig. 122, which is based wholly on the results obtained by the "Challenger"
  Expedition. The information as to littoral species is consequently inadequate, and we have not the
  data requisite for their discussion.</p>

  <p>Sponges generally (<i>a</i>) and Monaxonida in particular (<i>b</i>) are more generally
  distributed in water of depths of 51 to 200 fathoms than in depths of less than 50 fathoms; but
  localities in shallow water are <span class="pagenum" id="page240"><span
  class="smaller">{240}</span></span>richer, for the station curve (<i>a'</i>) rises abruptly from
  I. to II., while the species curve (<i>a</i>) in the same region is almost horizontal.</p>

  <p>The Hexactinellid curve (<i>c</i>) culminates on III., showing that the group is
  characteristically deep water. That for Tetractinellida (<i>d</i>) reaches its greatest height on
  II., <i>i.e.</i> between 51 and 200 fathoms. Even here, in their characteristic depths, the
  Tetractinellida fall below the Hexactinellida, and far below the Monaxonida in numbers. Again, the
  Monaxonida are commoner than Hexactinellida in deep water of 201 to 1000 fathoms, and it is not
  till depths of 1000 fathoms are passed that Hexactinellida prevail, finally preponderating over
  the Monaxonida in the ratio of 2:1.</p>

  <p>The Calcarea and Ceratosa are strictly shallow-water forms. It is a fact well worth
  consideration that the stations at which sponges have been found are situated, quite irrespective
  of depth, more or less in the neighbourhood of land. In the case of Calcarea and Ceratosa this is
  to be expected, seeing that shallow water is commonest near land, but it is surprising that it
  should be true also of the Hexactinellida and of the deep-water species of Tetractinellida and of
  Monaxonida.</p>

  <p>While the family groups are cosmopolitan, this is not true of genera and species. The
  distribution of genera and species makes it possible to define certain geographical provinces for
  sponges as for other animals. That this is so, is due to the existence of ocean tracts bare of
  islands; for ocean currents, can act as distributing agents with success only if they flow along a
  coast or across an ocean studded with islands. It is, of course, the larval forms which will be
  transported; whether they will ever develop to the adult condition depends on whether the current
  carrying them passes over a bottom suitable to their species before metamorphosis occurs and the
  young sponge sinks. If such a bottom is passed over, and if the depth is one which can be
  supported by the particular species in question, then a new station may thus be established for
  that species.</p>

  <p>The distance over which a larva may be carried depends on the speed of the current by which it
  is borne, and on the length of time occupied by its metamorphosis. Certain of the ocean currents
  accomplish 500 miles in six days; this gives some idea of the distance which may intervene between
  the birthplace and <span class="pagenum" id="page241"><span class="smaller">{241}</span></span>the
  final station of a sponge; for six days is not an excessive interval to allow for the larval
  period of at any rate some species.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution in Time.</b>&mdash;All that space permits us to say on the palaeontology of
  sponges has been said under the headings of the respective classes. We can here merely refer to
  the chronological table shown in Fig. 123:<a id="NtA_281"

  </div>

  <p><b>Flints.</b>&mdash;The ultimate source of all the silica in the sea and fresh-water areas is
  to be found in the decomposition of igneous rocks such as granite. The quantity of silica present
  in solution in sea water is exceedingly small, amounting to about one-and-a-half parts in 100,000;
  it certainly is not much more in average fresh water. This is no doubt due to its extraction by
  diatoms, which begin to extract it almost as soon as it is set free from the parent rock. It is
  from this small quantity that the siliceous sponges derive the supply from which they form their
  spicules. Hence it would appear that for the formation of one <span class="pagenum"
  id="page242"><span class="smaller">{242}</span></span>ounce of spicules at least one ton of sea
  water must pass through the body of the sponge. Obviously from such a weak solution the deposition
  of silica will not occur by ordinary physical agencies; it requires the unexplained action of
  living organisms. This may account for the fact that deposits of flint and chert are always
  associated with organic remains, such as Sponges and Radiolaria. By some process, the details of
  which are not yet understood, the silica of the skeleton passes into solution. In Calcareous
  deposits, a replacement of the carbonate of lime by the silica takes place, so that in the case of
  chalk the shells of Foraminifera, such as <i>Globigerina</i> and <i>Textularia</i> and those of
  Coccoliths, are converted into a siliceous chalk. Thus a siliceous chalk is the first stage in the
  formation of a flint.</p>

  <p>A further deposition of silica then follows, cementing this pulverulent material into a hard
  white porous flint. It is white for the same reason that snow is white. The deposition of silica
  continues, and the flint becomes at first grey and at last apparently black (black as ice is black
  on a pond). Frequently flints are found in all stages of formation: siliceous chalk with the
  corroded remains of sponge spicules may be found in the interior, black flint blotched with grey
  forming the mass of the nodule, while the exterior is completed by a thin layer of white porous
  flint. This layer must not be confused with the white layer which is frequently met with on the
  surface of weathered flints, which is due to a subsequent solution of some of the silica, so that
  by a process of unbuilding, the flint is brought back to the incompleted flint in its second
  stage. In the chalk adjacent to the flints, hollow casts of large sponge spicules may sometimes be
  observed, proving the fact, which is however unexplained, of the solution of the spicular silica.
  The formation of the flints appears to have taken place, to some extent at least, long after the
  death of the sponge, and even subsequent to the elevation of the chalk far above the sea-level, as
  is shown by the occurrence of layers of flints in the joints of the solid chalk.<a id="NtA_282"

  </div>

  <p>The great division of the animal kingdom called <span class="sc">Coelenterata</span> was
  constituted in 1847 by E. Leuckart for those animals which are commonly known as polyps and
  jelly-fishes. Cuvier had previously included these forms in his division Radiata or Zoophyta, when
  they were associated with the Starfishes, Brittle-stars, and the other Echinodermata.</p>

  <p>The splitting up of the Cuvierian division was rendered necessary by the progress of anatomical
  discovery, for whereas the Echinodermata possess an alimentary canal distinct from the other
  cavities of the body, in the polyps and jelly-fishes there is only one cavity to serve the
  purposes of digestion and the circulation of fluids. The name Coelenterata (<span title="koilos"
  class="fsn">&kappa;&omicron;&#x1FD6;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> = hollow, <span
  title="enteron" class="fsn">&#x1F14;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span> = the alimentary
  canal) was therefore introduced, and it may be taken to signify the important anatomical feature
  that the body-cavity (or coelom) and the cavity of the alimentary canal (or enteron) of these
  animals are not separate and distinct as they are in Echinoderms and most other animals.</p>

  <p>Many Coelenterata have a pronounced radial symmetry, the body being star-like, with the organs
  arranged symmetrically on lines radiating from a common centre. In this respect they have a
  superficial resemblance to many of the Echinodermata, which are also radially symmetrical in the
  adult stage. But it cannot be insisted upon too strongly that this superficial resemblance of the
  Coelenterata and Echinodermata has no genetic significance. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page246"><span class="smaller">{246}</span></span>The radial symmetry has been acquired in the
  two divisions along different lines of descent, and has no further significance than the
  adaptation of different animals to somewhat similar conditions of life. It is not only in the
  animals formerly classed by Cuvier as Radiata, but in sedentary worms, Polyzoa, Brachiopoda, and
  even Cephalopoda among the Mollusca, that we find a radial arrangement of some of the organs. It
  is interesting in this connexion to note that the word "polyp," so frequently applied to the
  individual Coelenterate animal or zooid, was originally introduced on a fancied resemblance of a
  <i>Hydra</i> to a small Cuttle-fish (<i>Fr.</i> Poulpe, <i>Lat.</i> Polypus).</p>

  <p>The body of the Coelenterate, then, consists of a body-wall enclosing a single cavity
  ("coelenteron"). The body-wall consists of an inner and an outer layer of cells, originally called
  by Allman the "endoderm" and "ectoderm" respectively. Between the two layers there is a substance
  chemically allied to mucin and usually of a jelly-like consistency, for which the convenient term
  "mesogloea," introduced by G. C. Bourne, is used (Fig. 125).</p>

  <p>The mesogloea may be very thin and inconspicuous, as it is in <i>Hydra</i> and many other
  sedentary forms, or it may become very thick, as in the jelly-fishes and some of the sedentary
  Alcyonaria. When it is very thick it is penetrated by wandering isolated cells from the ectoderm
  or endoderm, by strings of cells or by cell-lined canals; but even when it is cellular it must not
  be confounded with the third germinal layer or mesoblast which characterises the higher groups of
  animals, from which it differs essentially in origin and other characters. The Coelenterata are
  two-layered animals (<span class="sc">Diploblastica</span>), in contrast to the Metazoa with three
  layers of cells (<span class="sc">Triploblastica</span>). The growth of the mesogloea in many
  Coelenterata leads to modifications of the shape of the coelenteric cavity in various directions.
  In the Anthozoa, for example, the growth of vertical bands of mesogloea covered by endoderm
  divides the peripheral parts of the cavity into a series of intermesenterial compartments in open
  communication with the axial part of the cavity; and in the jelly-fishes the growth of the
  mesogloea reduces the cavity of the outer regions of the disc to a series of vessel-like
  canals.</p>

  <p>Another character, of great importance, possessed by all Coelenterata is the "nematocyst" or
  "thread-cell" (Fig. 124). <span class="pagenum" id="page247"><span
  class="smaller">{247}</span></span>This is an organ produced within the body of a cell called the
  "cnidoblast," and it consists of a vesicular wall or capsule, surrounding a cavity filled with
  fluid containing a long and usually spirally coiled thread continuous with the wall of the
  vesicle. When the nematocyst is fully developed and receives a stimulus of a certain character,
  the thread is shot out with great velocity and causes a sting on any part of an animal that is
  sufficiently delicate to be wounded by it.</p>

  <p>The morphology and physiology of the nematocysts are subjects of very great difficulty and
  complication, and cannot be discussed in these pages. It may, however, be said that by some
  authorities the cnidoblast is supposed to be an extremely modified form of mucous or gland cell,
  and that the discharge of the nematocyst is subject to the control of a primitive nervous system
  that is continuous through the body of the zooid.</p>

  <p>There is a considerable range of structure in the nematocysts of the Coelenterata. In
  <i>Alcyonium</i> and in many other Alcyonaria they are very small (in <i>Alcyonium</i> the
  nematocyst is 0.0075 mm. in length previous to discharge), and when discharged exhibit a simple
  oval capsule with a plain thread attached to it. In <i>Hydra</i> (Fig. 124) there are at least two
  kinds of nematocysts, and in the larger kind (0.02 mm. in length previous to discharge) the base
  of the thread is beset with a series of recurved hooks, which during the act of discharge probably
  assist in making a wound in the organism attacked for the injection of the irritant fluid, and
  possibly hold the structure in position while the thread is being discharged. In the large kind of
  nematocyst of <i>Millepora</i> and of <i>Cerianthus</i> there is a band of spirally arranged but
  very minute thorns in the middle of the thread, but none at the base. In some of the Siphonophora
  the undischarged nematocysts reach their maximum size, nearly 0.05 mm. in length.</p>

  </div>

  <p>When a nematocyst has once been discharged it is usually <span class="pagenum"
  id="page248"><span class="smaller">{248}</span></span>rejected from the body, and its place in the
  tissue is taken by a new nematocyst formed by a new cnidoblast; but in the thread of the large
  kind of nematocyst of <i>Millepora</i> there is a very delicate band, which appears to be similar
  to the myophan thread in the stalk of a <i>Vorticella</i>. Dr. Willey<a id="NtA_283"
  href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> has made the important observation that in this coral the
  nematocyst threads can be withdrawn after discharge, the retraction being effected with great
  rapidity. The "cnidoblast" is a specially modified cell. It sometimes bears at its free extremity
  a delicate process, the "cnidocil," which is supposed to be adapted to the reception of the
  special stimuli that determine the discharge of the nematocyst. In many species delicate
  contractile fibres (Fig. 124, <i>Mf</i>) can be seen in the substance of the cnidoblast, and in
  others its basal part is drawn out into a long and probably contractile stalk ("cnidopod"),
  attached to the mesogloea below.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt that new nematocysts are constantly formed during life to replace
  those that have been discharged and lost. Each nematocyst is developed within the cell-substance
  of a cnidoblast which is derived from the undifferentiated interstitial cell-groups. During this
  process the cnidoblast does not necessarily remain stationary, but may wander some considerable
  distance from its place of origin.<a id="NtA_284" href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> This habit
  of migration of the cnidoblast renders it difficult to determine whether the ectoderm alone, or
  both ectoderm and endoderm, can give rise to nematocysts. In the majority of Coelenterates the
  nematocysts are confined to the ectoderm, but in many Anthozoa, Scyphozoa, and Siphonophora they
  are found in tissues that are certainly or probably endodermic in origin. It has not been
  definitely proved in any case that the cnidoblast cells that form these nematocysts have
  originally been formed in the endoderm, and it is possible that they are always derived from
  ectoderm cells which migrate into the endoderm.</p>

  <p>It is probably true that all Coelenterata have nematocysts, and that, in the few cases in which
  it has been stated that they are absent (e.g. <i>Sarcophytum</i>), they have been overlooked. It
  cannot, however, be definitely stated that similar structures do not occur in other animals. The
  nematocysts of the Mollusc <i>Aeolis</i> are not the product of its own tissues, but are
  introduced <span class="pagenum" id="page249"><span class="smaller">{249}</span></span>into the
  body with its food.<a id="NtA_285" href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a> The nematocysts that occur
  in the Infusorian <i>Epistylis umbellaria</i> and in the Dinoflagellate <i>Polykrikos</i> (p. <a
  href="#page131">131</a>) require reinvestigation, but if it should prove that they are the product
  of the Protozoa they cannot be regarded as strictly homologous with those of Coelenterata. In many
  of the Turbellaria, however, and in some of the Nemertine worms, nematocysts occur in the
  epidermis which appear to be undoubtedly the products of these animals.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The Coelenterata are divided into three classes:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <span class="sc">Hydrozoa.</span>&mdash;Without stomodaeum and mesenteries. Sexual cells
  discharged directly to the exterior.</p>

  <p>2. <span class="sc">Scyphozoa.</span>&mdash;Without stomodaeum and mesenteries. Sexual cells
  discharged into the coelenteric cavity.</p>

  <p>3. <span class="sc">Anthozoa</span> = <span class="sc">Actinozoa</span>.&mdash;With stomodaeum
  and mesenteries. Sexual cells discharged into the coelenteric cavity.</p>

  <p>The full meaning of the brief statements concerning the structure of the three classes given
  above cannot be explained until the general anatomy of the classes has been described. It may be
  stated, however, in this place that many authors believe that structures corresponding with the
  stomodaeum and mesenteries of Anthozoa do occur in the Scyphozoa, which they therefore include in
  the class Anthozoa.</p>

  <p>Among the more familiar animals included in the class Hydrozoa may be mentioned the fresh-water
  polyp <i>Hydra</i>, the Hydroid zoophytes, many of the smaller Medusae or jelly-fish, the
  Portuguese Man-of-war (<i>Physalia</i>), and a few of the corals.</p>

  <p>Included in the Scyphozoa are the large jelly-fish found floating on the sea or cast up on the
  beach on the British shores.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Anthozoa include the Sea-anemones, nearly all the Stony Corals, the Sea-fans,
  the Black Corals, the Dead-men's fingers (<i>Alcyonium</i>), the Sea-pens, and the Precious Coral
  of commerce.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS I. HYDROZOA</p>

  <p>In this Class of Coelenterata two types of body-form may be found. In such a genus as
  <i>Obelia</i> there is a fixed branching colony of zooids, and each zooid consists of a simple
  tubular body-wall composed of the two layers of cells, the ectoderm and the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page250"><span class="smaller">{250}</span></span>endoderm (Fig. 125), terminating distally in
  a conical mound&mdash;the "hypostome"&mdash;which is perforated by the mouth and surrounded by a
  crown of tentacles. This fixed colony, the "hydrosome," feeds and increases in size by gemmation,
  but does not produce sexual cells. The hydrosome produces at a certain season of the year a number
  of buds, which develop into small bell-like jelly-fish called the "Medusae," which swim away from
  the parent stock and produce the sexual cells. The Medusa (Fig. 126) consists of a delicate
  dome-shaped contractile bell, perforated by radial canals and fringed with tentacles; and from its
  centre there depends, like the clapper of a bell, a tubular process, the manubrium, which bears
  the mouth at its extremity. This free-swimming sexual stage in the life-history of <i>Obelia</i>
  is called the "medusome."</p>

  <p>It is difficult to determine whether, in the evolution of the Hydrozoa, the hydrosome preceded
  the medusome or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. By some authors the medusome is regarded as a specially
  modified sexual individual of the hydrosome colony. By others the medusome is regarded as the
  typical adult Hydrozoon form, and the zooids of the hydrosome as nutritive individuals arrested in
  their development to give support to it. Whatever may be the right interpretation of the facts,
  however, it is found that in some forms the medusome stage is more or less degenerate and the
  hydrosome is predominant, whereas in others the hydrosome is degenerate or inconspicuous and the
  medusome is predominant. Finally, in some cases there are no traces, even in development, of a
  medusome stage, and the life-history is completed in the hydrosome, while in others the hydrosome
  stages are lost and the life-history is completed in the medusome.</p>

  <p>If a conspicuous hydrosome stage is represented by H, a conspicuous medusome stage by M, an
  inconspicuous or degenerate hydrosome stage by <i>h</i>, an inconspicuous or degenerate medusome
  stage by <i>m</i>, and the fertilised ovum by O, the life-histories of the Hydrozoa may be
  represented by the following formul&aelig;<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>The structure of the <b>hydrosome</b> is usually very simple. It <span class="pagenum"
  id="page251"><span class="smaller">{251}</span></span>consists of a branched tube opening by
  mouths at the ends of the branches and closed at the base. The body-wall is built up of ectoderm
  and endoderm. Between these layers there is a thin non-cellular lamella, the mesogloea.</p>

  <p>In a great many Hydrozoa the ectoderm secretes a chitinous protective tube called the
  "perisarc." The mouth is usually a small round aperture situated on the summit of the hypostome,
  and at the base of the hypostome there may be one or two crowns of tentacles or an area bearing
  irregularly scattered tentacles. The tentacles may be hollow, containing a cavity continuous with
  the coelenteric cavity of the body; or solid, the endoderm cells arranged in a single row forming
  an axial support for the ectoderm. The ectoderm of the tentacles is provided with numerous
  nematocysts, usually arranged in groups or clusters on the distal two-thirds of their length, but
  sometimes confined to a cap-like swelling at the extremity (capitate tentacles). The hydrosome may
  be a single zooid producing others asexually by gemmation (or more rarely by fission), which
  become free from the parent, or it may be a colony of zooids in organic connexion with one another
  formed by the continuous gemmation of the original zooid derived from the fertilised ovum and its
  asexually produced offspring. When the hydrosome is a colony of zooids, specialisation of certain
  individuals for particular functions may occur, and the colony becomes dimorphic or
  polymorphic.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <b>medusome</b> is more complicated in structure than the hydrosome, as it is adapted to
  the more varied conditions of a free-swimming existence. The body is expanded to form a disc,
  "umbrella," or bell, which bears at the edge or margin a number of tentacles. The mouth is
  situated on the end of a hypostome, called the "manubrium," situated in the centre of the radially
  symmetrical body. The surface that bears the manubrium is <span class="pagenum" id="page252"><span
  class="smaller">{252}</span></span>called oral, and the opposite surface is called aboral. The
  cavity partly enclosed by the oral aspect of the body when it is cup- or bell-shaped is called the
  "sub-umbrellar cavity."</p>

  <p>In the medusome of nearly all Hydrozoa there is a narrow shelf projecting inwards from the
  margin of the disc and guarding the opening of the sub-umbrellar cavity, called the "velum."</p>

  <p>The mouth leads through the manubrium into a flattened part of the coelenteric cavity, which is
  usually called the gastric cavity, and from this a number of canals pass radially through the
  mesogloea to join a circular canal or ring-canal at the margin of the umbrella.</p>

  <p>A special and important feature of the medusome is the presence of sense-organs called the
  "ocelli" and "statocysts," situated at the margin of the umbrella or at the base of the
  tentacles.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

  <p>The ocelli may usually be recognised as opaque red or blue spots on the bases of the tentacles,
  in marked contrast to their transparent surroundings. The ocellus may consist simply of a cluster
  of pigmented cells, or may be further differentiated as a cup of pigmented cells filled with a
  spherical thickening of the cuticle to form a lens. The exact function of the ocelli may not be
  fully understood, but there can be little doubt that they are light-perceiving organs.</p>

  <p>The function of the sense-organs known as statocysts, however, has not yet been so
  satisfactorily determined. They were formerly thought to be auditory organs, and were called
  "otocysts," but it appears now that it is impossible on physical grounds for these organs to be
  used for the perception of the waves of sound in water. It is more probable that they are organs
  of the static function, that is, the function of the perception of the position of the body in
  space, and they are consequently called statocysts. In the Leptomedusae each statocyst consists of
  a small vesicle in the mesogloea at the margin of the umbrella, containing a hard, stony body
  called the "statolith." In <i>Geryonia</i> and some other Trachomedusae the statolith is carried
  by a short tentacular process, the "statorhab," <span class="pagenum" id="page253"><span
  class="smaller">{253}</span></span>projecting into the vesicle; in other Trachomedusae, however,
  the vesicle is open, but forms a hood for the protection of the statorhab; and in others, but
  especially in the younger stages of development, the statorhab is not sunk into the margin of the
  umbrella, and resembles a short but loaded tentacle. Recent researches have shown that there is a
  complete series of connecting links between the vesiculate statocyst of the Leptomedusae and the
  free tentaculate statorhab of the Trachomedusae, and there can be little doubt of their general
  homology.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the free-swimming or "Phanerocodonic" medusome the sexual cells are borne by the
  ectoderm of the sub-umbrellar cavity either on the walls of the manubrium or subjacent to the
  course of the radial canals.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Eleutheroblastea.</b></p>

  <p>This order is constituted mainly for the well-known genus <i>Hydra</i>. By some authors
  <i>Hydra</i> is regarded as an aberrant member of the order Gymnoblastea, to which it is
  undoubtedly in many respects allied, but it presents so many features of special interest that it
  is better to keep it in a distinct group.</p>

  <p><i>Hydra</i> is one of the few examples of exclusively fresh-water Coelenterates, and like so
  many of the smaller fresh-water animals its distribution is almost cosmopolitan. It occurs not
  only in Europe and North America, but in New Zealand, Australia, tropical central Africa, and
  tropical central America.</p>

  <p><i>Hydra</i> is found in this country in clear, still fresh water attached to the stalks or
  leaves of weeds. When fully expanded it may be 25 mm. in length, but when completely retracted the
  same individual may be not more than 3 mm. long. The tubular body-wall is built up of ectoderm and
  endoderm, enclosing a simple undivided coelenteric cavity. The mouth is situated on the summit of
  the conical hypostome, and at the base of this there is a crown of long, delicate, but hollow
  tentacles. The number of tentacles is usually six in <i>H. vulgaris</i> and <i>H. oligactis</i>,<a
  id="NtA_286" href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a> and eight in <i>H. viridis</i>, but it is
  variable in all species.</p>

  <p>During the greater part of the summer the number of individuals is rapidly increased by
  gemmation. The young Hydras produced by gemmation are usually detached from their parents <span
  class="pagenum" id="page254"><span class="smaller">{254}</span></span>before they themselves
  produce buds, but in <i>H. oligactis</i> the buds often remain attached to the parent after they
  themselves have formed buds, and thus a small colony is produced. Sexual reproduction usually
  commences in this country in the summer and autumn, but as the statements of trustworthy authors
  are conflicting, it is probable that the time of appearance of the sexual organs varies according
  to the conditions of the environment.</p>

  <p>Individual specimens may be male, female, or hermaphrodite. Nussbaum<a id="NtA_287"
  href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a> has published the interesting observation that when the Hydras
  have been well fed the majority become female, when the food supply has been greatly restricted
  the majority become male, and when the food-supply is moderate in amount the majority become
  hermaphrodite. The gonads are simply clusters of sexual cells situated in the ectoderm. There is
  no evidence, derived from either their structure or their development, to show that they represent
  reduced medusiform gonophores. The testis produces a number of minute spermatozoa. In the ovary,
  however, only one large yolk-laden egg-cell reaches maturity by the absorption of the other eggs.
  The ovum is fertilised while still within the gonad, and undergoes the early stages of its
  development in that position. With the differentiation of an outer layer of cells a chitinous
  protecting membrane is formed, and the escape from the parent takes place.<a id="NtA_288"
  href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a> It seems probable that at this stage, namely, that of a
  protected embryo, there is often a prolonged period of rest, during which it may be carried by
  wind and other agencies for long distances without injury.</p>

  <p>The remarkable power that <i>Hydra</i> possesses of recovery from injury and of regenerating
  lost parts was first pointed out by Trembley in his classical memoir.<a id="NtA_289"
  href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A <i>Hydra</i> can be cut into a considerable number of pieces, and each piece, provided both
  ectoderm and endoderm are represented in it, will give rise by growth and regeneration to a
  complete zooid. There is, however, a limit of size below which fragments of <i>Hydra</i> will not
  regenerate, even if they contain <span class="pagenum" id="page255"><span
  class="smaller">{255}</span></span>cells of both layers. The statement made by Trembley, that when
  a <i>Hydra</i> is turned inside out it will continue to live in the introverted condition has not
  been confirmed, and it seems probable that after the experiment has been made the polyp remains in
  a paralysed condition for some time, and later reverts, somewhat suddenly, to the normal condition
  by a reversal of the process. There is certainly no substantial reason to believe that under any
  circumstances the ectoderm can undertake the function of the endoderm or the endoderm the
  functions of the ectoderm.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    <div class="smaller aj">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 127.</span>&mdash;A series of drawings of <i>Hydra</i>,
      showing the attitudes it assumes during one of the more rapid movements from place to place.
      1, The <i>Hydra</i> bending over to one side; 2, attaching itself to the support by the mouth
      and tentacles; 3, drawing the sucker up to the mouth; 4, inverted; 5, refixing the sucker; 6,
      reassuming the erect posture. (After Trembley.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the characteristic features of <i>Hydra</i> is the slightly expanded, disc-shaped aboral
  extremity usually called the "foot," an unfortunate term for which the word "sucker" should be
  substituted. There are no root-like tendrils or processes for attachment to the support such as
  are found in most of the solitary Gymnoblastea. The attachment of the body to the stem or weed or
  surface-film by this sucker enables the animal to change its position at will. It may either
  progress slowly by gliding along its support without the assistance of the tentacles, in a manner
  similar to that observed in many Sea-anemones; or more rapidly by a series of somersaults, as
  originally described by Trembley. The latter mode of locomotion has been recently described as
  follows:&mdash;"The body, expanded and with expanded tentacles, bends over to one side. As soon as
  the tentacles touch the bottom they attach themselves and contract. Now one of two things happens.
  The foot may loosen its hold on the bottom and the body contract. In this manner the animal comes
  to stand on its tentacles with the foot pointing upward. The body now bends over again until the
  foot attaches itself close to the attached tentacles. These loosen in their turn, and so the
  <i>Hydra</i> is again <span class="pagenum" id="page256"><span
  class="smaller">{256}</span></span>in its normal position. In the other case the foot is not
  detached, but glides along the support until it stands close to the tentacles, which now loosen
  their hold."<a id="NtA_290" href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Hydra</i> appears to be purely carnivorous. It will seize and swallow Entomostraca of
  relatively great size, so that the body-wall bulges to more than twice its normal diameter. But
  smaller Crustacea, Annelid worms, and pieces of flesh are readily seized and swallowed by a hungry
  <i>Hydra</i>. In <i>H. viridis</i> the chlorophyll corpuscles<a id="NtA_291"
  href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a> of the endoderm may possibly assist in the nourishment of the
  body by the formation of starch in direct sunlight.</p>

  <p>Three species of <i>Hydra</i> are usually recognised, but others which may be merely local
  varieties or are comparatively rare have been named.<a id="NtA_292"
  href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>H. viridis.</i>&mdash;Colour, grass-green. Average number of tentacles, eight. Tentacles
  shorter than the body. Embryonic chitinous membrane spherical and almost smooth.</p>

  <p><i>H. vulgaris</i>, Pallas (<i>H. grisea</i>, Linn.).&mdash;Colour, orange-brown. Tentacles
  rather longer than the body, average number, six. Embryonic chitinous membrane spherical, and
  covered with numerous pointed branched spines.</p>

  <p><i>H. oligactis</i>, Pallas (<i>H. fusca</i>, Linn.).&mdash;Colour, brown. Tentacles capable of
  great extension; sometimes, when fully expanded, several times the length of the body. Average
  number, six. Embryonic chitinous membrane plano-convex, its convex side only covered with
  spines.</p>

  <p>The genera <i>Microhydra</i> (Ryder) and <i>Protohydra</i> (Greeff) are probably allied to
  <i>Hydra</i>, but as their sexual organs have not been observed their real affinities are not yet
  determined. <i>Microhydra</i> resembles <i>Hydra</i> in its general form and habits, and in its
  method of reproduction by gemmation, but it has no tentacles. It was found in fresh water in North
  America.</p>

  <p><i>Protohydra</i><a id="NtA_293" href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a> was found in the
  oyster-beds off Ostend, and resembles <i>Microhydra</i> in the absence of tentacles. It multiplies
  by transverse fission, but neither gemmation nor sexual reproduction has been observed.</p>

  <p><i>Haleremita</i> is a minute hydriform zooid which is also marine. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page257"><span class="smaller">{257}</span></span>It was found by Schaudinn<a id="NtA_294"
  href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> in the marine aquarium at Berlin in water from Rovigno, on the
  Adriatic. It reproduces by gemmation, but sexual organs have not been found.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Another very remarkable genus usually associated with the Eleutheroblastea is
  <i>Polypodium</i>. At one stage of its life-history it has the form of a spiral ribbon or stolon
  which is parasitic on the eggs of the sturgeon (<i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>) in the river Volga.<a
  id="NtA_295" href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a> This stolon gives rise to a number of small
  <i>Hydra</i>-like zooids with twenty tentacles, of which sixteen are filamentous and eight
  club-shaped. These zooids multiply by longitudinal fission, and feed independently on Infusoria,
  Rotifers, and other minute organisms. The stages between these hydriform individuals and the
  parasitic stolon have not been discovered.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Milleporina.</b></p>

  <p><i>Millepora</i> was formerly united with the Stylasterina to form the order Hydrocorallina;
  but the increase of our knowledge of these Hydroid corals tends rather to emphasise than to
  minimise the distinction of <i>Millepora</i> from the Stylasterina.</p>

  <p><i>Millepora</i> resembles the Stylasterina in the production of a massive calcareous skeleton
  and in the dimorphism of the zooids, but in the characters of the sexual reproduction and in many
  minor anatomical and histological peculiarities it is distinct. As there is only one genus,
  <i>Millepora</i>, the account of its anatomy will serve as a description of the order.</p>

  <p>The skeleton (Fig. 128) consists of large lobate, plicate, ramified, or encrusting masses of
  calcium carbonate, reaching a size of one or two or more feet in height and breadth. The surface
  is perforated by numerous pores of two distinct sizes; the larger&mdash;"gastropores"&mdash;are
  about 0.25 mm. in diameter, and the smaller and more numerous "dactylopores" about 0.15 mm. in
  diameter. In many specimens the pores are arranged in definite cycles, each gastropore being
  surrounded by a circle of 5-7 dactylopores; but more generally the two kinds appear to be
  irregularly scattered on the surface.</p>

  <p>When a branch or lobe of a Millepore is broken across and examined in section, it is found that
  each pore is continued as a <span class="pagenum" id="page258"><span
  class="smaller">{258}</span></span>vertical tube divided into sections by horizontal calcareous
  plates (Fig. 129, <i>Tab</i>). These plates are the "tabulae," and constitute the character upon
  which <i>Millepora</i> was formerly placed in the now discarded group of Tabulate corals.</p>

  <p>The coral skeleton is also perforated by a very fine reticulum of canals, by which the
  pore-tubes are brought into communication with one another. In the axis of the larger branches and
  in the centre of the larger plates a considerable quantity of the skeleton is of an irregular
  spongy character, caused by the disintegrating influence of a boring filamentous Alga.<a

  </div>

  <p>The discovery that <i>Millepora</i> belongs to the Hydrozoa was made by Agassiz<a id="NtA_297"
  href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> in 1859, but Moseley<a id="NtA_298"
  href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> was the first to give <span class="pagenum" id="page259"><span
  class="smaller">{259}</span></span>an adequate account of the general anatomy. The colony consists
  of two kinds of zooids&mdash;the short, thick gastrozooids (Fig. 129, <i>G</i>) provided with a
  mouth and digestive endoderm, and the longer and more slender mouthless dactylozooids
  (<i>D</i>)&mdash;united together by a network of canals running in the porous channels of the
  superficial layer of the corallum. The living tissues of the zooids extend down the pore-tubes as
  far as the first tabulae, and below this level the canal-system is degenerate and functionless. It
  is only a very thin superficial stratum of the coral, therefore, that contains living tissues.</p>

  <p>The zooids of <i>Millepora</i> are very contractile, and can be withdrawn below the general
  surface of the coral into the shelter of the pore-tubes. When a specimen is examined in its
  natural position on the reef, the zooids are usually found to be thus contracted; but several
  observers have seen the zooids expanded in the living condition. It is probable that, as is the
  case with other corals, the expansion occurs principally during the night.</p>

  <p>The colony is provided with two kinds of nematocysts&mdash;the small kind and the large. In
  some colonies they are powerful enough to penetrate the human skin, and <i>Millepora</i> has
  therefore received locally the name of "stinging coral." On each of the dactylozooids there are
  six or seven short capitate tentacles (Fig. 129, <i>t</i>), each head being packed with
  nematocysts of the small kind; similar batteries of these nematocysts are found in the four short
  capitate tentacles of the gastrozooids. The nematocysts of the larger kind are found in the
  superficial ectoderm, some distributed irregularly on the surface, others in clusters round the
  pores. The small nematocysts are about 0.013 mm. in length before they are exploded, and exhibit
  four spines at the base of the thread; the large kind are oval in outline, 0.02 &times; 0.025 mm. in
  size, and exhibit no spines at the base, but a spiral band of minute spines in the middle of the
  filament. There is some reason to believe that the filament of the large kind of nematocysts can
  be retracted.<a id="NtA_299" href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

  <p>At certain seasons the colonies of <i>Millepora</i> produce a great number of male or female
  Medusae. The genus is probably dioecious, no instances of hermaphrodite colonies having yet been
  found. Each Medusa is formed in a cavity situated above the last-formed tabula in a pore-tube, and
  this cavity, the "ampulla," having a greater diameter than that of the gastrozooid tubes, can be
  recognised even in the dried skeleton.</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is not known how frequently the sexual seasons occur, but from the rarity in the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page261"><span class="smaller">{261}</span></span>collections of our museums
  of Millepore skeletons which exhibit the ampullae, it may be inferred that the intervals between
  successive seasons are of considerable duration.</p>

  <p>The Medusae of <i>Millepora</i> are extremely simple in character. There is a short mouthless
  manubrium bearing the sexual cells, an umbrella without radial canals, while four or five knobs at
  the margin, each supporting a battery of nematocysts, represent all that there is of the marginal
  tentacles. The male Medusae have not yet been observed to escape from the parent, but from the
  fact that the spermatozoa are not ripe while they are in the ampullae, it may be assumed that the
  Medusae are set free. Duerden, however, has observed the escape of the female Medusae, and it
  seems probable from his observations that their independent life is a short one, the ova being
  discharged very soon after liberation.</p>

  <p><i>Millepora</i> appears to be essentially a shallow-water reef coral. It may be found on the
  coral reefs of the Western Atlantic extending as far north as Bermuda, in the Red Sea, the Indian
  and Pacific Oceans. The greatest depth at which it has hitherto been found is 15 fathoms on the
  Macclesfield Bank, and it flourishes at a depth of 7 fathoms off Funafuti in the Pacific
  Ocean.</p>

  <p><i>Millepora</i>, like many other corals, bears in its canals and zooids a great number of the
  symbiotic unicellular "Algae" (Chrysomonadaceae, see pp. <a href="#page86">86</a>, <a
  href="#page125">125</a>) known as Zooxanthellae. All specimens that have been examined contain
  these organisms in abundance, and it has been suggested that the coral is largely dependent upon
  the activity of the "Algae" for its supply of nourishment. There can be no doubt that the
  dactylozooids do paralyse and catch living animals, which are ingested and digested by the
  gastrozooids, but this normal food-supply may require to be supplemented by the carbohydrates
  formed by the plant-cells. But as the carbohydrates can only be formed by the "Algae" in sunlight,
  this supplementary food-supply can only be provided in corals that live in shallow water. It must
  not be supposed that this is the only cause that limits the distribution of <i>Millepora</i> in
  depth, but it may be an important one.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The generic name <i>Millepora</i> has been applied to a great many fossils from
  different strata, but a critical examination of their structure fails to show any sufficient
  reason for including many of them in the genus or even in the order. Fossils that are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page262"><span class="smaller">{262}</span></span>undoubtedly <i>Millepora</i>
  occur in the raised coral reefs of relatively recent date, but do not extend back into Tertiary
  times. There seems to be no doubt, therefore, that the genus is of comparatively recent origin.
  Among the extinct fossils the genus that comes nearest to it is <i>Axopora</i> from the Eocene of
  France, but this genus differs from <i>Millepora</i> in having monomorphic, not dimorphic, pores,
  and in the presence of a minute spine or columella in the centre of each tube. The resemblances
  are to be observed in the general disposition of the canal system and of the tabulation. Whether
  <i>Axopora</i> is or is not a true Milleporine, however, cannot at present be determined, but it
  is the only extinct coral that merits consideration in this place.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order III. Gymnoblastea&mdash;Anthomedusae.</b></p>

  <p>This order was formerly united with the Calyptoblastea to form the order Hydromedusae, but the
  differences between the two are sufficiently pronounced to merit their treatment as distinct
  orders.</p>

  <p>In many of the Gymnoblastea the sexual cells are borne by free Medusae, which may be recognised
  as the Medusae of Gymnoblastea by the possession of certain distinct characters. The name given to
  such Medusae, whether their hydrosome stage is known or not, is Anthomedusae. The Gymnoblastea are
  solitary or colonial Hydrozoa, in which the free (oral) extremity of the zooids, including the
  crown of tentacles, is not protected by a skeletal cup. The sexual cells may be borne by free
  Anthomedusae, or by more or less degenerate Anthomedusae that are never detached from the parent
  hydrosome. The Anthomedusae are small or minute Medusae provided with a velum, with the ovaries or
  sperm-sacs borne by the manubrium and with sense-organs in the form of ocelli or pigment-spots
  situated on the margin of the umbrella.</p>

  <p>The solitary Gymnoblastea present so many important differences in anatomical structure that
  they cannot be united in a single family. They are usually fixed to some solid object by root-like
  processes from the aboral extremity, the "hydrorhiza," or are partly embedded in the sand
  (<i>Corymorpha</i>), into which long filamentous processes project for the support of the zooid.
  The remarkable species <i>Hypolytus peregrinus</i><a id="NtA_300"
  href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> from Wood's Holl, <span class="pagenum" id="page263"><span
  class="smaller">{263}</span></span>however, has no aboral processes, and appears to be only
  temporarily attached to foreign objects by the secretion of the perisarc. Among the solitary
  Gymnoblastea several species reach a gigantic size. <i>Corymorpha</i> is 50-75 mm. in length, but
  <i>Monocaulus</i> from deep water in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is nearly 8 feet in length.
  Among the solitary forms attention must be called to the interesting pelagic <i>Pelagohydra</i>
  (see p. <a href="#page274">274</a>).</p>

  <p>The method of colony formation in the Gymnoblastea is very varied. In some cases (<i>Clava
  squamata</i>) a number of zooids arise from a plexus of canals which corresponds with the system
  of root-like processes of the solitary forms. In <i>Hydractinia</i> this plexus is very dense, and
  the ectoderm forms a continuous sheet of tissue both above and below. The colony is increased in
  size in these cases by the gemmation of zooids from the hydrorhiza. In other forms, such as
  <i>Tubularia larynx</i>, new zooids arise not only from the canals of the hydrorhiza, but also
  from the body-walls of the upstanding zooids, and thus a bushy or shrubby colony is formed.</p>

  <p>In another group the first-formed zooid produces a hydrorhiza of considerable proportions,
  which fixes the colony firmly to a stone or shell and increases in size with the growth of the
  colony. This zooid itself by considerable growth in length forms the axis of the colony, and by
  gemmation gives rise to lateral zooids, which in their turn grow to form the lateral branches and
  give rise to the secondary branches, and these to the tertiary branches, and so one; each branch
  terminating in a mouth, hypostome and crown of tentacles. Such a method of colony formation is
  seen in <i>Bougainvillia</i> (Fig. 130). A still more complicated form of colony formation is seen
  in <i>Ceratella</i>, in which not a single but a considerable number of zooids form the axis of
  the colony and of its branches. As each axis is covered with a continuous coat of ectoderm, and
  each zooid of such an axis secretes a chitinous fenestrated tube, the whole colony is far more
  rigid and compact than is usual in the Gymnoblastea, and has a certain superficial resemblance to
  a Gorgoniid Alcyonarian (Fig. 133, p. <a href="#page271">271</a>).</p>

  <p>The branches of the colony and a considerable portion of the body-wall of each zooid in the
  Gymnoblastea are usually protected by a thin, unjointed "perisarc" of chitin secreted by the
  ectoderm; but this skeletal structure does not expand distally to <span class="pagenum"
  id="page264"><span class="smaller">{264}</span></span>form a cup-like receptacle in which the oral
  extremity of the zooid can be retracted for protection.</p>

  <p>The zooids of the Gymnoblastea present considerable diversity of form and structure. The
  tentacles may be reduced to one (in <i>Monobrachium</i>) or two (in <i>Lar sabellarum</i>), but
  usually the number is variable in each individual colony. In many cases, such as
  <i>Cordylophora</i>, <i>Clava</i>, and many others, the tentacles are irregularly scattered on the
  sides of the zooids. In others there may be a single circlet of about ten or twelve tentacles
  round the base of the hypostome. In some genera the tentacles are arranged in two series
  (<i>Tubularia</i>, <i>Corymorpha</i>, <i>Monocaulus</i>), a distal series round the margin of the
  mouth which may be arranged in a single circlet or scattered irregularly on the hypostome, and a
  proximal series arranged in a single circlet some little distance from the mouth. In
  <i>Branchiocerianthus imperator</i> the number of tentacles is very great, each of the two
  circlets consisting of about two hundred tentacles.</p>

      <i>t.z</i>, terminal zooid.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The zooids of the hydrosome are usually monomorphic, but there are cases in which different
  forms of zooid occur in the same colony. In <i>Hydractinia</i>, for example, no less than four
  different kinds of zooids have been described. These are called gastrozooids, dactylozooids,
  tentaculozooids, and blastostyles respectively. The "gastrozooids" are provided with a conical
  hypostome bearing the mouth and two closely-set circlets of some ten to thirty tentacles. The
  "dactylozooids" are longer than the gastrozooids and have the habit of actively coiling and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page265"><span class="smaller">{265}</span></span>uncoiling themselves; they
  have a small mouth and a single circlet of rudimentary tentacles. The "tentaculozooids" are
  situated at the outskirts of the colony, and are very long and slender, with rudimentary tentacles
  and no mouth. The "blastostyles," usually shorter than the gastrozooids, have two circlets of
  rudimentary tentacles and a mouth. They bear on their sides the spherical or oval gonophores.</p>

  <p>The medusome stage in the life-history of these Hydrozoa is produced by gemmation from the
  hydrosome, or, in some cases, by gemmation from the medusome as well as from the hydrosome. In
  many genera and species the medusome is set free as a minute jelly-fish or Medusa, which grows and
  develops as an independent organism until the time when the sexual cells are ripe, and then
  apparently it dies. In other Gymnoblastea the medusome either in the female or the male or in both
  sexes does not become detached from the parent hydrosome, but bears the ripe sexual cells,
  discharges them into the water, and degenerates without leading an independent life at all. In
  these cases the principal organs of the medusome are almost or entirely functionless, and they
  exhibit more or less imperfect development, or they may be so rudimentary that the medusoid
  characters are no longer obvious. Both the free and the undetached medusomes are gonophores, that
  is to say, the bearers of the sexual cells, but the former were described by Allman as the
  "phanerocodonic" gonophores, <i>i.e.</i> "with manifest bells," and the latter as the
  "adelocodonic" gonophores. The gonophores may arise either from an ordinary zooid of the colony
  (<i>Syncoryne</i>), from a specially modified zooid&mdash;the blastostyle&mdash;as in
  <i>Hydractinia</i>, or from the hydrorhiza as in certain species of <i>Perigonimus</i>. The
  free-swimming Medusa may itself produce Medusae by gemmation from the manubrium (<i>Sarsia</i>,
  <i>Lizzia</i>, <i>Rathkea</i>, and others), from the base of the tentacles (<i>Sarsia</i>,
  <i>Corymorpha</i>, <i>Hybocodon</i>), or from the margin of the umbrella (<i>Eleutheria</i>).</p>

  <p>The free-swimming Medusae or phanerocodonic gonophores of the Gymnoblastea are usually of small
  size (1 or 2 mm. in diameter) when first liberated, and rarely attain a great size even when fully
  mature. They consist of a circular, bell-shaped or flattened disc&mdash;the
  umbrella&mdash;provided at its margin with a few or numerous tentacles, and a tubular manubrium
  bearing the mouth depending from the exact centre of the under (oral) <span class="pagenum"
  id="page266"><span class="smaller">{266}</span></span>side of the umbrella (Fig. 132, A). The
  mouth leads into a shallow digestive cavity, from which radial canals pass through the substance
  of the umbrella to join a ring-canal at the margin (Fig. 131).</p>

  <p>The sense-organs of the Medusae of the Gymnoblastea are in the form of pigment-spots or very
  simple eyes (ocelli), situated at the bases of the tentacles. The orifice of the umbrella is
  guarded by a thin shelf or membrane, as in the Calyptoblastea, called the velum. The sexual cells
  are borne by the manubrium (Figs. 131 and 132, A).</p>

  <p>There are many modifications observed in the different genera as regards the number of
  tentacles, the number and character of the radial canals, the minute structure of the
  sense-organs, and some other characters, but they agree in having a velum, ocellar sense-organs,
  and manubrial sexual organs. The tentacles are rudimentary in <i>Amalthea</i>; in
  <i>Corymorpha</i> there is only one tentacle; in <i>Perigonimus</i> there are two; and in
  <i>Bougainvillia</i> they are numerous; but the usual number is four or six. The radial canals are
  usually simple and four in number, but there are six in <i>Lar sabellarum</i>, which branch twice
  or three times before reaching the margin of the umbrella (Fig. 132, B).</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There can be no doubt that the Medusae of many Gymnoblastea undergo several important changes
  in their anatomical features during the period of the ripening of the sexual cells. Thus in <i>Lar
  sabellarum</i> the six radial canals are simple in the first stage of development (A); but in the
  second stage (B) each radial canal bifurcates before reaching the margin, and in the adult stage
  shows a double bifurcation. The life-history has, however, been worked out in very few of the
  Anthomedusae, and there can be little doubt that as our knowledge grows several forms which are
  now known as distinct species <span class="pagenum" id="page267"><span

  <p>The movements of the Medusae are well described by Allman<a id="NtA_301"
  href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> in his account of <i>Cladonema radiatum</i>:&mdash;"It is
  impossible to grow tired of watching this beautiful medusa; sometimes while dashing through the
  water with vigorous diastole and systole, it will all at once attach its grapples to the side of
  the vessel, and become suddenly arrested in its career, and then after a period of repose, during
  which its branched tentacles are thrown back over its umbrella and extended into long filaments
  which float, like some microscopic sea-weed in the water, it will once more free itself from its
  moorings and start off with renewed energy." The Medusa of <i>Clavatella</i>, "in its movements
  and mode of life, presents a marked contrast to the medusiform zooid of other Hydrozoa. The latter
  is active and mercurial, dancing gaily through the water by means of the vigorous strokes of its
  crystalline swimming-bell. The former strides leisurely along, or, using the adhesive discs as
  hands, climbs amongst the branches of the weed. In the latter stage of its existence it becomes
  stationary, fixing itself by means of its suckers; and <span class="pagenum" id="page268"><span
  class="smaller">{268}</span></span>thus it remains, the capitate arms standing out rigidly, like
  the rays of a starfish, until the embryos are ready to escape."<a id="NtA_302"
  href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Among the Gymnoblastea there are many examples of a curious association of the Hydroid with
  some other living animals. Thus <i>Hydractinia</i> is very often found on the shells carried by
  living Hermit crabs, <i>Dicoryne</i> on the shells of various Molluscs, <i>Tubularia</i> has been
  found on a Cephalopod, and <i>Ectopleura</i> (a Corymorphid) on the carapace of a crab. There is
  but little evidence, however, that in these cases the association is anything more than
  accidental. The occurrence of the curious species, <i>Lar sabellarum</i>, on the tubes of
  <i>Sabella</i>, of <i>Campaniclava cleodorae</i> on the living shells of the pelagic Mollusc
  <i>Cleodora cuspidata</i>, and of a <i>Gorgonia</i> on the tubes of <i>Tubularia parasitica</i>,
  appear to be cases in which there is some mutual relationship between the two comrades. The genus
  <i>Stylactis</i>, however, affords some of the most interesting examples of mutualism. Thus
  <i>Stylactis vermicola</i> is found only on the back of an <i>Aphrodite</i> that lives at the
  great depth of 2900 fathoms. <i>S. spongicola</i> and <i>S. abyssicola</i> are found associated
  with certain deep-sea Horny Sponges. <i>S. minoi</i> is spread over the skin of the little rock
  perch <i>Minous inermis</i>, which is found at depths of from 45 to 150 fathoms in the Indian
  seas.</p>

  <p>In many cases it is difficult to understand what is the advantage of the Hydroid to the animal
  that carries it, but in this last case Alcock<a id="NtA_303" href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a>
  suggests that the <i>Stylactis</i> assists in giving the fish a deceitful resemblance to the
  incrusted rocks of its environment, in order to allure, or at any rate not to scare, its prey.
  Whether this is the real explanation or not, the fact that in the Bay of Bengal and in the
  Laccadive and Malabar seas the fish is never found without this Hydroid, nor the Hydroid without
  this species of fish, suggests very strongly that there is a mutual advantage in the
  association.</p>

  <p>Cases of undoubted parasitism are very rare in this order. The remarkable form <i>Hydrichthys
  mirus</i>,<a id="NtA_304" href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a> supposed to be a Gymnoblastic
  Hydroid, but of very uncertain position in the system, appears to be somewhat modified in its
  structure by its parasitic habits on the fish <i>Seriola zonata</i>. <i>Corydendrium <span
  class="pagenum" id="page269"><span class="smaller">{269}</span></span>parasiticum</i> is said to
  be a parasite living at the expense of <i>Eudendrium racemosum</i>. <i>Mnestra</i> is a little
  Medusa which attaches itself by its manubrium to the Mollusc <i>Phyllirhoe</i>, and may possibly
  feed upon the skin or secretions of its host.</p>

  <p>Nearly all the species of the order are found in shallow sea water. <i>Stylactis vermicola</i>
  and the "Challenger" specimen of <i>Monocaulus imperator</i> occur at a depth of 2900 fathoms, and
  some species of the genera <i>Eudendrium</i> and <i>Myriothela</i> descend in some localities to a
  depth of a few hundred fathoms. <i>Cordylophora</i> is the only genus known to occur in fresh
  water. From its habit of attaching itself to wooden piers and probably to the bottom of barges,
  and from its occurrence in navigable rivers and canals, it has been suggested that
  <i>Cordylophora</i> is but a recent immigrant into our fresh-water system. It has been found in
  England in the Victoria docks of London, in the Norfolk Broads, and in the Bridgewater Canal. It
  has ascended the Seine in France, and may now be found in the ponds of the Jardin des Plantes at
  Paris. It also occurs in the Elbe and in some of the rivers of Denmark.</p>

  <p>The classification of the Gymnoblastea is not yet on a satisfactory basis. At present the
  hydrosome stage of some genera alone has been described, of others the free-swimming Medusa only
  is known. Until the full life-history of any one genus has been ascertained its position in the
  families mentioned below may be regarded as only provisional. The principal families are<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><b>Fam. Bougainvilliidae.</b>&mdash;The zooids of the hydrosome have a single circlet of
  filiform tentacles at the base of the hypostome. In <i>Bougainvillia</i> belonging to this family
  the gonophores are liberated in the form of free-swimming Medusae formerly known by the generic
  name <i>Hippocrene</i>. In the fully grown Medusa there are numerous tentacles arranged in
  clusters opposite the terminations of the four radial canals. There are usually in addition
  tentacular processes (labial tentacles) on the lips of the manubrium. <i>Bougainvillia</i> is a
  common British zoophyte of branching habit, found in shallow water all round the coast. The
  medusome of <i>Bougainvillia ramosa</i> is said to be the common little medusa <i>Margelis
  ramosa</i>.<a id="NtA_305" href="#Nt_305"><sup>[305]</sup></a> Like most of the Hydroids it has a
  wide geographical distribution. Other genera are <i>Perigonimus</i>, which has a Medusa with only
  two tentacles; and <span class="pagenum" id="page270"><span
  class="smaller">{270}</span></span><i>Dicoryne</i>, which forms spreading colonies on Gasteropod
  shells and has free gonophores provided with two simple tentacles, while the other organs of the
  medusome are remarkably degenerate. In <i>Garveia</i> and <i>Eudendrium</i> the gonophores are
  adelocodonic, in the former genus arising from the body-wall of the axial zooids of the colony,
  and in the latter from the hydrorhiza. <i>Stylactis</i> is sometimes epizoic (p. <a
  href="#page268">268</a>). Among the genera that are usually placed in this family, of which the
  medusome stage only is known, are <i>Lizzia</i> (a very common British Medusa) and <i>Rathkea</i>.
  In <i>Margelopsis</i> the hydrosome stage consists of a single free-swimming zooid which produces
  Medusae by gemmation.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Podocorynidae.</b>&mdash;The zooids have the same general features as those of the
  Bougainvilliidae, but the perisarc does not extend beyond the hydrorhiza.</p>

  <p>In <i>Podocoryne</i> and <i>Hydractinia</i> belonging to this family the hydrorhiza forms an
  encrusting stolon which is usually found on Gasteropod shells containing a living Hermit crab. In
  <i>Podocoryne</i> the gonophores are free-swimming Medusae with a short manubrium provided with
  labial tentacles. <i>Hydractinia</i> differs from <i>Podocoryne</i> in having polymorphic zooids
  and adelocodonic gonophores.</p>

  <p>A fossil encrusting a <i>Nassa</i> shell from the Pliocene deposit of Italy has been placed in
  the genus <i>Hydractinia</i>, and four species of the same genus have been described from the
  Miocene and Upper Greensand deposits of this country.<a id="NtA_306"
  href="#Nt_306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> These are the only fossils known at present that can be
  regarded as Gymnoblastic Hydroids.</p>

  <p>The Medusa <i>Thamnostylus</i>, which has only two marginal tentacles and four very long and
  profusely ramified labial tentacles, is placed in this family. Its hydrosome stage is not
  known.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Clavatellidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains the genus <i>Clavatella</i>, in which the
  zooids of the hydrosome have a single circlet of capitate tentacles. The gonophore is a free
  Medusa provided with six bifurcated capitate tentacles.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Cladonemidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains the genus <i>Cladonema</i>, in which the
  zooids have two circlets of four tentacles, the labial tentacles being capitate and the aboral
  filiform. The gonophore is a free Medusa with eight tentacles, each provided with a number of
  curious capitate tentacular processes (Fig. 131).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page271"><span class="smaller">{271}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. Tubulariidae.</b>&mdash;This important and cosmopolitan family is represented in the
  British seas by several common species. The zooids of the hydrosome of <i>Tubularia</i> have two
  circlets of numerous filiform tentacles. The gonophores are adelocodonic, and are situated on long
  peduncles attached to the zooid on the upper side of the aboral circlet of tentacles. The larva
  escapes from the gonophore and acquires two tentacles, with which it beats the water and, assisted
  by the cilia, keeps itself afloat for some time. In this stage it is known as an "Actinula."<a

  <p><b>Fam. Ceratellidae.</b>&mdash;The colony of <i>Ceratella</i> may be five inches in height.
  The stem and main branches are substantial, and consist of a network of branching anastomosing
  tubes supported by a thick and fenestrated chitinous perisarc. The <span class="pagenum"
  id="page272"><span class="smaller">{272}</span></span>whole branch is enclosed in a common layer
  of ectoderm. The zooids have scattered capitate tentacles. The Ceratellidae occur in shallow water
  off the coast of New South Wales, extend up the coast of East Africa as far as Zanzibar, and have
  also been described from Japan.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Pennariidae.</b>&mdash;In the hydrosome stage the zooids have numerous oral capitate
  tentacles scattered on the hypostome, and a single circlet of basilar filiform tentacles. The
  medusa of <i>Pennaria</i>, a common genus of wide distribution, is known under the name
  <i>Globiceps</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Corynidae.</b>&mdash;In the hydrosome stage the zooids of this family possess numerous
  capitate tentacles arranged in several circlets or scattered.</p>

  <p>In <i>Cladocoryne</i> the tentacles are branched. <i>Syncoryne</i> is a common and widely
  distributed genus with numerous unbranched capitate tentacles irregularly distributed over a
  considerable length of the body-wall of the zooid. In many of the species the gonophores are
  liberated as Medusae, known by the name <i>Sarsia</i>, provided with four filiform tentacles and a
  very long manubrium. In some species (<i>S. prolifera</i> and <i>S. siphonophora</i>) the Medusae
  are reproduced asexually by gemmation from the long manubrium. A common British Anthomedusa of
  this family is <i>Dipurena</i>, but its hydrosome stage is not known. In the closely related genus
  <i>Coryne</i> the gonophores are adelocodonic, and exhibit very rudimentary medusoid
  characters.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Clavidae.</b>&mdash;This is a large family containing many genera, some with
  free-swimming Medusae, others with adelocodonic gonophores. In the former group are included a
  number of oceanic Medusae of which the hydrosome stage has not yet been discovered. The zooids of
  the hydrosome have numerous scattered filiform tentacles. The free-swimming Medusae have hollow
  tentacles.</p>

  <p><i>Clava</i> contains a common British species with a creeping hydrorhiza frequently attached
  to shells, and with adelocodonic gonophores. <i>Cordylophora</i> is the genus which has migrated
  into fresh water in certain European localities (see p. <a href="#page269">269</a>). It forms
  well-developed branching colonies attached to wooden gates and piers or to the brickwork banks of
  canals. Several Anthomedusae, of which the hydrosome stage is not known, appear to be related to
  the Medusae of this family, but are sometimes separated as <span class="pagenum"
  id="page273"><span class="smaller">{273}</span></span>the family <b>Tiaridae</b>. Of these
  <i>Tiara</i>, a very brightly coloured jelly-fish sometimes attaining a height of 40 mm., is found
  on the British coasts, and <i>Amphinema</i> is found in considerable numbers at Plymouth in
  September. <i>Turritopsis</i> is a Medusa with a hydrosome stage like <i>Dendroclava</i>. For
  <i>Stomatoca</i>, see p. <a href="#page415">415</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Corymorphidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains the interesting British species
  <i>Corymorpha nutans</i>. The hydrosome stage consists of a solitary zooid of great size, 50-75
  mm. in length, provided with two circlets of numerous long filiform tentacles. The free-swimming
  Medusae are produced in great numbers on the region between the two circlets of tentacles. These
  Medusae were formerly known by the name <i>Steenstrupia</i>, and are noteworthy in having only one
  long moniliform tentacle, opposite to one of the radial canals.</p>

  <p>The gigantic <i>Monocaulus imperator</i> of Allman was obtained by the "Challenger" at the
  great depth of 2900 fathoms off the coast of Japan. It was nearly eight feet in length. More
  recently Miyajima<a id="NtA_309" href="#Nt_309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> has described a specimen from
  250 fathoms in the same seas which was 700 mm. (27.5 in.) in length. Miyajima's specimen resembles
  those described by Mark from 300 fathoms off the Pacific coast of North America as
  <i>Branchiocerianthus urceolus</i> in the remarkable feature of a distinct bilateral arrangement
  of the circlets of tentacles. Owing to the imperfect state of preservation of the only specimen of
  Allman's species it is difficult to determine whether it is also bilaterally symmetrical and
  belongs to the same species as the specimens described by Mark and Miyajima. These deep-sea giant
  species, however, appear to differ from <i>Corymorpha</i> in having adelocodonic gonophores.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Hydrolaridae.</b>&mdash;This family contains the remarkable genus <i>Lar</i>, which was
  discovered by Gosse attached to the margin of the tubes of the marine Polychaete worm
  <i>Sabella</i>. The zooids have only two tentacles, and exhibit during life curious bowing and
  bending movements which have been compared with the exercises of a gymnast. The Medusae (Fig. 132,
  A and B) have been known for a long time by the name <i>Willsia</i>, but their life-history has
  only recently been worked out by Browne.<a id="NtA_310" href="#Nt_310"><sup>[310]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page274"><span class="smaller">{274}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. Monobrachiidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Monobrachium</i>, found in the White Sea by Mereschkowsky,
  forms a creeping stolon on the shells of <i>Tellina</i>. The zooids of the hydrosome have only one
  tentacle.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Myriothelidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains the single genus <i>Myriothela</i>. The
  zooid of the hydrosome stage is solitary and is provided, as in the Corynidae, with numerous
  scattered capitate tentacles. The gonophores are borne by blastostyles situated above the region
  of the tentacles. In addition to these blastostyles producing gonophores there are, in <i>M.
  phrygia</i>, supplementary blastostyles which capture the eggs as they escape from the gonophores
  and hold them until the time when the larva is ready to escape. They were called "claspers" by
  Allman. In some of the Arctic species Frl. Bonnevie<a id="NtA_311"
  href="#Nt_311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> has shown that they are absent. Each zooid of <i>M.
  phrygia</i> is hermaphrodite.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. Pelagohydridae.</b>&mdash;This family was constituted by Dendy<a id="NtA_312"
  href="#Nt_312"><sup>[312]</sup></a> for the reception of <i>Pelagohydra mirabilis</i>, a
  remarkable new species discovered by him on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The
  hydrosome is solitary and free-swimming, the proximal portion of the body being modified to form a
  float, the distal portion forming a flexible proboscis terminated by the mouth and a group of
  scattered manubrial tentacles. The tentacles are filiform and scattered over the surface of the
  float. Medusae are developed on stolons between the tentacles of the float. They have tentacles
  arranged in four radial groups of five each, at the margin of the umbrella.</p>

  <p>As pointed out by Hartlaub,<a id="NtA_313" href="#Nt_313"><sup>[313]</sup></a>
  <i>Pelagohydra</i> is not the only genus in which the hydrosome floats. Three species of the genus
  <i>Margelopsis</i> have been found that have pelagic habits, and two <span class="pagenum"
  id="page275"><span class="smaller">{275}</span></span>of them have been shown to produce numerous
  free-swimming Medusae by gemmation; but at present there is no reason to suppose that in these
  forms there is any extensive modification of the aboral extremity of the zooid to form such a
  highly specialised organ as the float of <i>Pelagohydra</i>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The affinities of <i>Pelagohydra</i> are not clear, as our knowledge of the
  characters of the Medusa is imperfect; but according to Dendy it is most closely related to the
  Corymorphidae. <i>Margelopsis</i> belongs to the Bougainvilliidae.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order IV. Calyptoblastea&mdash;Leptomedusae.</b></p>

  <p>The hydrosome stage is characterised by the perisarc, which not only envelops the stem and
  branches, as in many of the Gymnoblastea, but is continued into a trumpet-shaped or tubular cup or
  collar called the "hydrotheca," that usually affords an efficient protection for the zooids when
  retracted. No solitary Calyptoblastea have been discovered. In the simpler forms the colony
  consists of a creeping hydrorhiza, from which the zooids arise singly (<i>Clytia johnstoni</i>),
  but these zooids may give rise to a lateral bud which grows longer than the parent zooid.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      Greatly enlarged. (After Nutting.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The larger colonies are usually formed by alternate right and left budding from the last-formed
  zooid, so that in contrast to the Gymnoblast colony the apical zooid of the stem is the youngest,
  and not the oldest, zooid of the colony. In the branching colonies the axis is frequently composed
  of a single tube of perisarc, which may be lined internally by the ectoderm and endoderm tissues
  formed by the succession of zooids that have given rise to the branches by gemmation. Such a stem
  is said to be monosiphonic.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page276"><span class="smaller">{276}</span></span></div>

  <p>In some of the more complicated colonies, however, the stem is composed of several tubes, which
  may or may not be surrounded by a common sheath of ectoderm and perisarc, as they are in
  <i>Ceratella</i> among the Gymnoblastea. Such stems are said to be "polysiphonic" or "fascicled."
  The polysiphonic stem may arise in more than one way, and in some cases it is not quite clear in
  what manner it has arisen.<a id="NtA_314" href="#Nt_314"><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In many colonies the zooids are only borne by the terminal monosiphonic branches, which receive
  the special name "hydrocladia." The gonophores of the Calyptoblastea are usually borne by
  rudimentary zooids, devoid of mouth and tentacles (the "blastostyles"), protected by a specially
  dilated cup of perisarc known as the "gonotheca" or "gonangium." The shape and size of the
  gonothecae vary a good deal in the order. They may be simply oval in shape, or globular
  (<i>Schizotricha dichotoma</i>), or greatly elongated, with the distal ends produced into slender
  necks (<i>Plumularia setacea</i>). They are spinulose in <i>P. echinulata</i>, and annulated in
  <i>P. halecioides</i>, <i>Clytia</i>, etc.</p>

  <p>In some genera there are special modifications of the branches and hydrocladia, for the
  protection of the gonothecae. The name "Phylactocarp" is used to designate structures that are
  obviously intended to serve this purpose. The phylactocarp of the genera <i>Aglaophenia</i> and
  <i>Thecocarpus</i> is the largest and most remarkable of this group of structures, and has
  received the special name "corbula." The corbula consists of an axial stem or rachis, and of a
  number of corbula-leaves arising alternately from the rachis, bending upwards and then inwards to
  meet those of the other side above, the whole forming a pod-shaped receptacle. The gonangia are
  borne at the base of each of the corbula-leaves. There is some difference of opinion as to the
  homologies of the parts of the corbula, but the rachis seems to be that of a modified
  hydrocladium, as it usually bears at its base one or more hydrothecae of the normal type. The
  corbula-leaves are usually described as modified nematophores (<i>vide infra</i>), but according
  to Nutting<a id="NtA_315" href="#Nt_315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> there is no more reason to regard
  them as modified nematophores than as modified hydrothecae, and he regards them as "simply the
  modification of a structure originally intended to <span class="pagenum" id="page277"><span
  class="smaller">{277}</span></span>protect an indefinite person, an individual that may become
  either a sarcostyle<a id="NtA_316" href="#Nt_316"><sup>[316]</sup></a> or a hydranth."</p>

  <p>The other forms of phylactocarps are modified branches as in <i>Lytocarpus</i>, and those which
  are morphologically appendages to branches as in <i>Cladocarpus</i>, <i>Aglaophenopsis</i>, and
  <i>Streptocaulus</i>.</p>

  <p>The structures known as "nematophores" in the Calyptoblastea are the thecae of modified zooids,
  comparable with the dactylozooids of <i>Millepora</i>. They form a well-marked character of the
  very large family Plumulariidae, but they are also found in species of the genera <i>Ophiodes</i>,
  <i>Lafo&euml;ina</i>, <i>Oplorhiza</i>, <i>Perisiphonia</i>, <i>Diplocyathus</i>, <i>Halecium</i>, and
  <i>Clathrozoon</i> among the other Calyptoblastea. The dactylozooids are usually capitate or
  filiform zooids, without tentacles or a mouth, and with a solid or occasionally a perforated core
  of endoderm. They bear either a battery of nematocysts (<i>Plumularia</i>, etc.), or of peculiar
  adhesive cells (<i>Aglaophenia</i> and some species of <i>Plumularia</i>). The functions of the
  dactylozooids are to capture the prey and to serve as a defence to the colony. In the growth of
  the corbula of <i>Aglaophenia</i> the dactylozooids appear to serve another purpose, and that is,
  as a temporary attachment to hold the leaves together while the edges themselves are being
  connected by trabeculae of coenosarc.</p>

  <p>In a very large number of Calyptoblastea the gonophore is a reduced Medusa which never escapes
  from the gonotheca, but in the family Eucopidae the gonophores escape as free-swimming Medusae,
  exhibiting certain very definite characters. The gonads are situated not on the manubrium, as in
  the Anthomedusae, but on the sub-umbrellar aspect of the radial canals. The marginal sense-organs
  may be ocelli or vesiculate statocysts. The bell is usually more flattened, and the velum smaller
  than it is in the Anthomedusae, and the manubrium short and quadrangular. Such Medusae are called
  Leptomedusae.</p>

  <p>Leptomedusae of many specific forms are found abundantly at the surface of the sea in nearly
  all parts of the world, but with the exception of some genera of the Eucopidae and a few others,
  their connexion with a definite Calyptoblastic hydrosome has not been definitely ascertained. It
  may be an assumption that time will prove to be unwarranted that all the Leptomedusae pass through
  a Calyptoblastic hydrosome stage.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page278"><span class="smaller">{278}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. Aequoreidae.</b>&mdash;In this family the hydrosome stage is not known except in the
  genus <i>Polycanna</i>, in which it resembles a Campanulariid. The sense-organs of the Medusae are
  statocysts. The radial canals are very numerous, and the genital glands are in the form of ropes
  of cells extending along the whole of their oral surfaces. <i>Aequorea</i> is a fairly common
  genus, with a flattened umbrella and a very rudimentary manubrium, which may attain a size of 40
  mm. in diameter.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Thaumantiidae.</b>&mdash;The Medusae of this family are distinguished from the
  Aequoreidae by having marginal ocelli in place of statocysts. The hydrosome of <i>Thaumantias</i>
  alone is known, and this is very similar to an <i>Obelia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Cannotidae.</b>&mdash;The hydrosome is quite unknown. The Medusae are ocellate, but the
  radial canals, instead of being undivided, as in the Thaumantiidae, are four in number, and very
  much ramified before reaching the ring canal. The tentacles are very numerous. In the genus
  <i>Polyorchis</i>, from the Pacific coast of North America, the four radial canals give rise to
  numerous lateral short blind branches, and have therefore a remarkable pinnate appearance.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Sertulariidae.</b>&mdash;In this family the hydrothecae are sessile, and arranged
  bilaterally on the stem and branches. The general form of the colony is pinnate, the branches
  being usually on opposite sides of the main stem. The gonophores are adelocodonic.
  <i>Sertularia</i> forms more or less arborescent colonies, springing from a creeping stolon
  attached to stones and shells. There are many species, several of which are very common upon the
  British coast. Many specimens are torn from their attachments by storms or by the trawls of
  fishermen and cast up on the sand or beach with other zoophytes. The popular name for one of the
  commonest species (<i>S. abietina</i>) is the "sea-fir." The genus has a wide geographical and
  bathymetrical range. Another common British species frequently thrown up by the tide in great
  quantities is <i>Hydrallmania falcata</i>. It has slender spirally-twisted stems and branches, and
  the hydrothecae are arranged unilaterally.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Grammaria</i>, sometimes placed in a separate family, is distinguished from
  <i>Sertularia</i> by several characters. The stem and branches are composed of a number of tubes
  which are considerably compressed. The genus is confined to the southern seas.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page279"><span class="smaller">{279}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. Plumulariidae.</b>&mdash;The hydrothecae are sessile, and arranged in a single row on
  the stem and branches. Nematophores are always present. Gonophores adelocodonic. This family is
  the largest and most widely distributed of all the families of the Hydrozoa. Nutting calculates
  that it contains more than one-fourth of all the Hydroids of the world. Over 300 species have been
  described, and more than half of these are found in the West Indian and Australian regions.
  Representatives of the family occur in abundance in depths down to 300 fathoms, and not
  unfrequently to 500 fathoms. Only a few species have occasionally been found in depths of over
  1000 fathoms.</p>

  <p>The presence of nematophores may be taken as the most characteristic feature of the family, but
  similar structures are also found in some species belonging to other families (p. <a
  href="#page277">277</a>).</p>

  <p>The family is divided into two groups of genera, the <span class="sc">Eleutheroplea</span> and
  the <span class="sc">Statoplea</span>. In the former the nematophores are mounted on a slender
  pedicel, which admits of more or less movement, and in the latter the nematophores are sessile.
  The genera <i>Plumularia</i> and <i>Antennularia</i> belong to the Eleutheroplea. The former is a
  very large genus, with several common British species, distinguished by the terminal branches
  being pinnately disposed, and the latter, represented by <i>A. antennina</i> and <i>A. ramosa</i>
  on the British coast, is distinguished by the terminal branches being arranged in verticils.</p>

  <p>The two most important genera of the Statoplea are <i>Aglaophenia</i> and <i>Cladocarpus</i>.
  The former is represented by a few species in European waters, the latter is only found in
  American waters.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Hydroceratinidae.</b>&mdash;The colony consists of a mass of entwined hydrorhiza, with
  a skeleton in the form of anastomosing chitinous tubes. Hydrothecae scattered, tubular, and
  sessile. Nematophores present. Gonophores probably adelocodonic.</p>

  <p>This family was constituted for a remarkable hydroid, <i>Clathrozoon wilsoni</i>, described by
  W. B. Spencer from Victoria.<a id="NtA_317" href="#Nt_317"><sup>[317]</sup></a> The zooids are
  sessile, and spring from more than one of the numerous anastomosing tubes of the stem and

  class="smaller">{280}</span></span>a few specimens have hitherto been obtained, the largest being
  10 inches in height by 4 inches in width. In general appearance it has some resemblance to a dark
  coloured fan-shaped <i>Gorgonia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Campanulariidae.</b>&mdash;The hydrothecae in this family are pedunculate, and the
  gonophores adelocodonic.</p>

  <p>In the cosmopolitan genus <i>Campanularia</i> the stem is monosiphonic, and the hydrothecae
  bell-shaped. Several species of this genus are very common in the rock pools of our coast between
  tide marks. <i>Halecium</i> is characterised by the rudimentary character of its hydrothecae,
  which are incapable of receiving the zooids even in their maximum condition of retraction. The
  genus <i>Lafoea</i> is remarkable for the development of a large number of tightly packed
  gonothecae on the hydrorhiza, each of which contains a blastostyle, bearing a single gonophore
  and, in the female, a single ovum. This group of gonothecae was regarded as a distinct genus of
  Hydroids, and was named <i>Coppinia</i>.<a id="NtA_318" href="#Nt_318"><sup>[318]</sup></a>
  <i>Lafoea dumosa</i> with gonothecae of the type described as <i>Coppinia arcta</i> occurs on the
  British coast.</p>

  <p><i>Perisiphonia</i> is an interesting genus from deep water off the Azores, Australia, and New
  Zealand, with a stem composed of many distinct tubes.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Zygophylax</i>, from 500 fathoms off the Cape Verde, is of considerable interest
  in having a nematophore on each side of the hydrotheca. According to Quelch it should be placed in
  a distinct family.</p>

  <p><i>Ophiodes</i> has long and very active defensive zooids, protected by nematophores. It is
  found in the Laminarian zone on the English coast.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Eucopidae.</b>&mdash;The hydrosome stage of this family is very similar to that of the
  Campanulariidae, but the gonophores are free-swimming Medusae of the Leptomedusan type.</p>

  <p>One of the best-known genera is <i>Obelia</i>, of which several species are among the commonest
  Hydroids of the British coast.</p>

  <p><i>Clytia johnstoni</i> is also a very common Hydroid, growing on red algae or leaves of the
  weed <i>Zostera</i>. It consists of a number of upright, simple, or slightly branched stems
  springing from a creeping hydrorhiza. When liberated the Medusae are globular in form, with four
  radial canals and four marginal tentacles, but <span class="pagenum" id="page281"><span
  class="smaller">{281}</span></span>this Medusa, like many others of the order, undergoes
  considerable changes in form before it reaches the sexually mature stage.</p>

  <p><i>Phialidium temporarium</i> is one of the commonest Medusae of our coast, and sometimes
  occurs in shoals. It seems probable that it is the Medusa of <i>Clytia johnstoni</i>.<a
  id="NtA_319" href="#Nt_319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> By some authors the jelly-fish known as
  <i>Epenthesis</i> is also believed to be the Medusa of a <i>Clytia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Dendrograptidae.</b>&mdash;This family includes a number of fossils which have certain
  distinct affinities with the Calyptoblastea. In <i>Dictyonema</i>, common in the Ordovician rocks
  of Norway, but also found in the Palaeozoic rocks of North America and elsewhere, the fossil forms
  fan-shaped colonies of delicate filaments, united by many transverse commissures, and in
  well-preserved specimens the terminal branches bear well-marked uniserial hydrothecae. In some
  species thecae of a different character, which have been interpreted to be gonothecae and
  nematophores respectively, are found.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Other genera are <i>Dendrograptus</i>, <i>Thamnograptus</i>, and several others
  from Silurian strata.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order V. Graptolitoidea.</b></p>

  <p>A large number of fossils, usually called Graptolites, occurring in Palaeozoic strata, are
  generally regarded as the skeletal remains of an ancient group of Hydrozoa.</p>

  <p>In the simpler forms the fossil consists of a delicate straight rod bearing on one side a
  series of small cups. It is suggested that the cups contained hydroid zooids, and should therefore
  be regarded as the equivalent of the hydrothecae, and that the axis represents the axis of the
  colony or of a branch of the Calyptoblastea. In some of the forms with two rows of cups on the
  axis (<i>Diplograptus</i>), however, it has been shown that the cups are absent from a
  considerable portion of one end of the axis, and that the axes of several radially arranged
  individuals are fused together and united to a central circular plate. Moreover, there is found in
  many specimens a series of vesicles, a little larger in size than the cups, attached to the plate
  and arranged in a circle at the base of the axes. These vesicles are called the gonothecae.</p>

  <p>The discovery of the central plate and of the so-called <span class="pagenum"
  id="page282"><span class="smaller">{282}</span></span>gonothecae suggests that the usual
  comparison of a Graptolite with a Sertularian Hydroid is erroneous, and that the colony or
  individual, when alive, was a more or less radially symmetrical floating form, like a Medusa, of
  which only the distal appendages (possibly tentacles) are commonly preserved as fossils.</p>

  <p>The evidence that the Graptolites were Hydrozoa is in reality very slight, but the proof of
  their relationship to any other phylum of the animal kingdom does not exist.<a id="NtA_320"
  href="#Nt_320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> It is therefore convenient to consider them in this place, and
  to regard them, provisionally, as related to the Calyptoblastea.</p>

  <p>The order is divided into three families.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Monoprionidae.</b>&mdash;Cups arranged uniserially on one side of the axis.</p>

  <p>The principal genera are <i>Monograptus</i>, with the axis straight, curved, or helicoid, from
  many horizons in the Silurian strata; <i>Rastrites</i>, with a spirally coiled axis, Silurian;
  <i>Didymograptus</i>, Ordovician; and <i>Coenograptus</i>, Ordovician.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Diprionidae.</b>&mdash;Cups arranged in two or four vertical rows on the axis.</p>

  <p><i>Diplograptus</i>, Ordovician and Silurian; <i>Climacograptus</i>, Ordovician and Silurian;
  and <i>Phyllograptus</i>, in which the axis and cups are arranged in such a manner that they
  resemble an ovate leaf.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Retiolitidae.</b>&mdash;Cups arranged biserially on a reticulate axis.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Retiolites</i>, Ordovician and Silurian; <i>Stomatograptus</i>,
  <i>Retiograptus</i>, and <i>Glossograptus</i>, Ordovician.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Fossil Corals possibly allied to Hydrozoa.</b></p>

  <p>Among the many fossil corals that are usually classified with the Hydrozoa the genus
  <i>Porosphaera</i> is of interest as it is often supposed to be related to <i>Millepora</i>. It
  consists of globular masses about 10-20 mm. in diameter occurring in the Upper Cretaceous strata.
  In the centre there is usually a foreign body around which the coral was formed by concentric
  encrusting growth. Running radially from pores on the surface to the centre, there are numerous
  tubules which have a certain general resemblance to the pore-tubes of <i>Millepora</i>. The
  monomorphic <span class="pagenum" id="page283"><span class="smaller">{283}</span></span>character
  of these tubes, their very minute size, the absence of ampullae, and the general texture of the
  corallum, are characters which separate this fossil very distinctly from any recent Hydroid
  corals. <i>Porosphaera</i>, therefore, was probably not a Hydrozoon, and certainly not related to
  the recent <i>Millepora</i>.</p>

  <p>Closely related to <i>Porosphaera</i> apparently are other globular, ellipsoidal, or fusiform
  corals from various strata, such as <i>Loftusia</i> from the Eocene of Persia, <i>Parkeria</i>
  from the Cambridge Greensand, and <i>Heterastridium</i> from the Alpine Trias. In the last named
  there is apparently a dimorphism of the radial tubes.</p>

  <p>Allied to these genera, again, but occurring in the form of thick, concentric, calcareous
  lamellae, are the genera <i>Ellipsactinia</i> and <i>Sphaeractinia</i> from the Upper
  Jurassic.</p>

  <p>Another important series of fossil corals is that of the family <b>Stromatoporidae</b>. These
  fossils are found in great beds of immense extent in many of the Palaeozoic rocks, and must have
  played an important part in the geological processes of that period. They consist of a series of
  calcareous lamellae, separated by considerable intervals, encrusting foreign bodies of various
  kinds. Sometimes they are flat and plate-like, sometimes globular or nodular in form. The lamellae
  are in some cases perforated by tabulate, vertical, or radial pores, but in many others these
  pores are absent. The zoological position of the Stromatoporidae is very uncertain, but there is
  not at present any very conclusive evidence that they are Hydrozoa.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Stromatopora</i> is common in Devonian and also occurs in Silurian strata.
  <i>Cannopora</i> from the Devonian has well-marked tabulate pores, and is often found associated
  commensally with another coral (<i>Aulopora</i> or <i>Syringopora</i>).</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order VI. Stylasterina.</b></p>

  <p>The genera included in this order resemble <i>Millepora</i> in producing a massive calcareous
  skeleton, and in showing a consistent dimorphism of the zooids, but in many respects they exhibit
  great divergence from the characters of the Milleporina.</p>

  <p>The colony is arborescent in growth, the branches arising frequently only in one plane, forming
  a flabellum. The calcareous skeleton is perforated to a considerable depth by the gastrozooids,
  dactylozooids, and nutritive canals, and the <span class="pagenum" id="page284"><span
  class="smaller">{284}</span></span>gastropores and dactylopores are not provided with tabulae
  except in the genera <i>Pliobothrus</i> and <i>Sporadopora</i>. The character which gives the
  order its name is a conical, sometimes torch-like projection at the base of the gastropore, called
  the "style," which carries a fold of the ectoderm and endoderm layers of the body-wall, and may
  serve to increase the absorptive surface of the digestive cavity. In some genera a style is also
  present in the dactylopore, in which case it serves as an additional surface for the attachment of
  the retractor muscles. The pores are scattered on all aspects of the coral in the genera
  <i>Sporadopora</i>, <i>Errina</i>, and <i>Pliobothrus</i>; in <i>Spinipora</i> and
  <i>Steganopora</i> the scattered dactylopores are situated at the extremities of tubular spines
  which project from the general surface of the coral, the gastropores being situated irregularly
  between the spines. In <i>Phalangopora</i> the pores are arranged in regular longitudinal lines,
  and in <i>Distichopora</i> they are mainly in rows on the edges of the flattened branches, a
  single row of gastropores being flanked by a single row of dactylopores on each side. In the
  remaining genera the pores are arranged in definite cycles, which are frequently separated from
  one another by considerable intervals, and have, particularly in the dried skeleton, a certain
  resemblance to the calices of some of the Zoantharian corals.</p>

  <p>In <i>Cryptohelia</i> the cycles are covered by a lid-like projection from the neighbouring
  coenenchym (Fig. 136, <i>l</i> 1, <i>l</i> 2). The gastrozooids are short, and are usually
  provided with a variable number of small capitate tentacles. The dactylozooids are filiform and
  devoid of tentacles, the endoderm of their axes being solid and scalariform.</p>

  <p>The gonophores of the Stylasterina are situated in large oval or spherical cavities called the
  ampullae, and their presence can generally be detected by the dome-shaped projections they form on
  the surface of the coral. The female gonophore consists of a saucer-shaped pad of folded endoderm
  called the "trophodisc," which serves the purpose of nourishing the single large yolk-laden egg it
  bears; and a thin enveloping membrane composed of at least two layers of cells. The egg is
  fertilised while it is still within the ampulla, and does not escape to the exterior until it has
  reached the stage of a solid ciliated larva. All the Stylasterina are therefore viviparous. The
  male gonophore has a very much smaller trophodisc, which is sometimes (<i>Allopora</i>) prolonged
  into a columnar process or spadix, penetrating the <span class="pagenum" id="page285"><span
  class="smaller">{285}</span></span>greater part of the gonad. The spermatozoa escape through a
  peculiar spout-like duct which perforates the superficial wall of the ampulla. In some genera
  (<i>Distichopora</i>) there are several male gonophores in each ampulla.</p>

  <p>The gonophores of the Stylasterina have been regarded as much altered medusiform gonophores,
  and this view may possibly prove to be correct. At present, however, the evidence of their
  derivation from Medusae is not conclusive, and it is possible that they may have had a totally
  independent origin.</p>

  <p><i>Distichopora</i> and some species of <i>Stylaster</i> are found in shallow water in the
  tropics, but most of the genera are confined to deep or very deep water, and have a wide
  geographical distribution. No species have been found hitherto within the British area.</p>

  <p>A few specimens of a species of <i>Stylaster</i> have been found in Tertiary deposits and in
  some raised beaches of more recent origin, but the order is not represented in the older
  strata.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Stylasteridae.</b>&mdash;All the genera at present known are included in this
  family.</p>

  <p><i>Sporadopora</i> is the only genus that presents a superficial general resemblance to
  <i>Millepora</i>. It forms massive, branching white coralla, with the pores scattered irregularly
  on the surface, and, like many varieties of <i>Millepora</i>, not arranged in cyclosystems. It
  may, however, be distinguished at once by the presence of a long, brush-like style in each of the
  gastropores. The ampullae are large, but are usually so deep-seated in the coenenchym that their
  presence cannot be detected from the surface. It was found off the Rio de la Plata in 600 fathoms
  of water by the "Challenger."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page286"><span class="smaller">{286}</span></span></div>

  <p>In <i>Errina</i> the pores are sometimes irregularly scattered, but in <i>E. glabra</i> they
  are arranged in rows on the sides of the branches, while in <i>E. ramosa</i> the gastropores occur
  at the angles of the branches only. The dactylopores are situated on nariform projections of the
  corallum. The ampullae are prominent. There are several gonophores in each ampulla of the male,
  but only one in each ampulla of the female. This genus is very widely distributed in water from
  100 to 500 fathoms in depth.</p>

  <p><i>Phalangopora</i> differs from <i>Errina</i> in the absence of a style in the gastropore;
  Mauritius.&mdash;<i>Pliobothrus</i> has also no style in the gastropore, and is found in 100-600
  fathoms of water off the American Atlantic shores.</p>

  <p><i>Distichopora</i> is an important genus, which is found in nearly all the shallow seas of the
  tropical and semi-tropical parts of the world, and may even flourish in rock pools between tide
  marks. It is nearly always brightly coloured&mdash;purple, violet, pale brown, or rose red. The
  colony usually forms a small flabellum, with anastomosing branches, and the pores are arranged in
  three rows, a middle row of gastropores and two lateral rows of dactylopores on the sides of the
  branches. There is a long style in each gastropore. The ampullae are numerous and prominent,
  situated on the anterior and posterior faces of the branches. Each ampulla contains a single
  gonophore in the female colony and two or three gonophores in the male colony.</p>

  <p><i>Spinipora</i> is a rare genus from off the Rio de la Plata in 600 fathoms. The branches are
  covered with blunt spines. These spines have a short gutter-like groove at the apex, which leads
  into a dactylopore. The gastropores are provided with a style and are situated between the
  spines.</p>

  <p><i>Steganopora</i><a id="NtA_321" href="#Nt_321"><sup>[321]</sup></a> from the Djilolo Passage,
  in about 600 fathoms, is very similar to <i>Spinipora</i> as regards external features, but
  differs from it in the absence of styles in the gastropores, and in the wide communications
  between the gastropores and dactylopores.</p>

  <p><i>Stylaster</i> is the largest and most widely distributed genus of the family, and exhibits a
  considerable range of structure in the many species it contains. It is found in all the warmer
  seas of the world, living between tide marks at a few fathoms, and extending to depths of 600
  fathoms. Many specimens, but especially those from very shallow water, are of a beautiful rose
  <span class="pagenum" id="page287"><span class="smaller">{287}</span></span>or pink colour. The
  corallum is arborescent and usually flabelliform. The pores are distributed in regular
  cyclosystems, sometimes on one face of the corallum only, sometimes on the sides of the branches,
  and sometimes evenly distributed. There are styles in both gastropores and dactylopores.</p>

  <p><i>Allopora</i> is difficult to separate from <i>Stylaster</i>, but the species are usually
  more robust in habit, and the ampullae are not so prominent as they are on the more delicate
  branches of <i>Stylaster</i>. It occurs at depths of 100 fathoms in the Norwegian fjords. A very
  large red species (<i>A. nobilis</i>) occurs in False Bay, Cape of Good Hope, in 30 fathoms of
  water. In this locality the coral occurs in great submarine beds or forests, and the trawl that is
  passed over them is torn to pieces by the hard, thick branches, some of which are an inch or more
  in diameter.</p>

  <p><i>Astylus</i> is a genus found in the southern Philippine sea in 500 fathoms of water. It is
  distinguished from <i>Stylaster</i> by the absence of a style in the gastropore.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><i>Cryptohelia</i> is an interesting genus found both in the Atlantic and Pacific
  Oceans at depths of from 270 to about 600 fathoms. The cyclosystems are covered by a projecting
  lid or operculum (Fig. 136, <i>l</i> 1, <i>l</i> 2). There are no styles in either the gastropores
  or the dactylopores. The ampullae are prominent, and are sometimes situated in the lids. There are
  several gonophores in each ampulla of the female colony, and a great many in the ampulla of the
  male colony.</p>

  TRACHOMEDUSAE&mdash;NARCOMEDUSAE&mdash;SIPHONOPHORA</span></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order VII. Trachomedusae.</b></p>

  <p>The orders Trachomedusae and Narcomedusae are probably closely related to one another and to
  some of the families of Medusae at present included in the order Calyptoblastea, and it seems
  probable that when the life-histories of a few more genera are made known the three orders will be
  united into one. Very little is known of the hydrosome stage of the Trachomedusae, but Brooks<a
  id="NtA_322" href="#Nt_322"><sup>[322]</sup></a> has shown that in <i>Liriope</i>, and Murbach<a
  id="NtA_323" href="#Nt_323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> that in <i>Gonionema</i>, the fertilised ovum
  gives rise to a <i>Hydra</i>-like form, and in the latter this exhibits a process of reproduction
  by gemmation before it gives rise to Medusae. Any general statement, therefore, to the effect that
  the development of the Trachomedusae is direct would be incorrect. The fact that the hydrosomes
  already known are epizoic or free-swimming does not afford a character of importance for
  distinction from the Leptomedusae, for it is quite possible that in this order of Medusae the
  hydrosomes of many genera may be similar in form and habits to those of <i>Liriope</i> and
  <i>Gonionema</i>.</p>

  <p>The free border of the umbrella of the Trachomedusae is entire; that is to say, it is not lobed
  or fringed as it is in the Narcomedusae. The sense-organs are statocysts, each consisting of a
  vesicle formed by a more or less complete fold of the surrounding wall of the margin of the
  umbrella, containing a reduced clapper-like tentacle loaded at its extremity with a statolith.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page289"><span class="smaller">{289}</span></span></div>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 137.</span>&mdash;<i>Liriope rosacea</i>, one of the
      Geryoniidae, from the west side of North and Central America. Size, 15-20 mm. Colour, rose.

      manubrium; <i>ot</i>, statocyst; <i>t</i>, tentacle; <i>to</i>, tongue. (After Maas.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This statocyst is innervated by the outer nerve ring. There appears to be a very marked
  difference between these marginal sense-organs in some of the best-known examples of Trachomedusae
  and the corresponding organs of the Leptomedusae. The absence of a stalk supporting the statolith
  and the innervation of the otocyst by the inner instead of by the outer nerve ring in the
  Leptomedusae form characters that may be of supplementary value, but cannot be regarded as
  absolutely distinguishing the two orders. The statorhab of the Trachomedusae is probably the more
  primitive of the two types, and represents a marginal tentacle of the umbrella reduced in size,
  loaded with a statolith and enclosed by the mesogloea. Intermediate stages between this type and
  an ordinary tentacle have already been discovered and described. In the type that is usually found
  in the Leptomedusae the modified tentacle is still further reduced, and all that can be recognised
  of it is the statolith attached to the wall of the statocyst, but intermediate stages between the
  two types are seen in the family Olindiidae, in which the stalk supporting the statolith passes
  gradually into the tissue surrounding the statolith on the one hand and the vesicle wall on the
  other. The radial canals are four or eight in number or more numerous. They communicate at the
  margin of the umbrella with a ring canal from which a number of short blind tubes run in the
  umbrella-wall towards the centre of the Medusa (Fig. 137, <i>cp</i>). These "centripetal canals"
  are subject to <span class="pagenum" id="page290"><span
  class="smaller">{290}</span></span>considerable variation, but are useful characters in
  distinguishing the Trachomedusae from the Leptomedusae. The tentacles are situated on the margin
  of the umbrella, and are four or eight in number or, in some cases, more numerous. The gonads are
  situated as in Leptomedusae on the sub-umbrella aspect of the radial canals.</p>

  <p>In <i>Gonionema murbachii</i> the fertilised eggs give rise to a free-swimming ciliated larva
  of an oval shape with one pole longer and narrower than the other. The mouth appears subsequently
  at the narrower pole. The larva settles down upon the broader pole, the mouth appears at the free
  extremity, and in a few days two, and later two more, tentacles are formed (Fig. 138).</p>

  <p>At this stage the larva may be said to be <i>Hydra</i>-like in character, and as shown in Fig.
  138 it feeds and lives an independent existence. From its body-wall buds arise which separate from
  the parent and give rise to similar <i>Hydra</i>-like individuals. An asexual generation thus
  gives rise to new individuals by gemmation as in the hydrosome of the Calyptoblastea. The origin
  of the Medusae from this <i>Hydra</i>-like stage has not been satisfactorily determined, but it
  seems probable that by a process of metamorphosis the hydriform persons are directly changed into
  the Medusae.<a id="NtA_324" href="#Nt_324"><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 138.</span>&mdash;Hydra-like stage in the development of
      <i>Gonionema murbachii</i>. One of the tentacles is carrying a worm (<i>W</i>) to the mouth.
      The tentacles are shown very much contracted, but they are capable of extending to a length of
      2 mm. Height of zooid about 1 mm. (After Perkins.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the development of <i>Liriope</i> the free-swimming larva develops into a hydriform person
  with four tentacles and an enormously elongated hypostome or manubrium; and, according to Brooks,
  it undergoes a metamorphosis which directly converts it into a Medusa.</p>

  <p>There can be very little doubt that in a large number of Trachomedusae the development is
  direct, the fertilised ovum giving rise to a medusome without the intervention of a hydrosome
  stage. In some cases, however (<i>Geryonia</i>, etc.), the tentacles <span class="pagenum"
  id="page291"><span class="smaller">{291}</span></span>appear in development before there is any
  trace of a sub-umbrella cavity, and this has been interpreted to be a transitory but definite
  Hydroid stage. It may be supposed that the elimination of the hydrosome stage in these
  Coelenterates may be associated with their adaptation to a life in the ocean far from the
  coast.</p>

  <p>During the growth of the Medusa from the younger to the adult stages several changes probably
  occur of a not unimportant character, and it may prove that several genera now placed in the same
  or even different families are stages in the development, of the same species. In the development
  of <i>Liriantha appendiculata</i>,<a id="NtA_325" href="#Nt_325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> for example,
  four interradial tentacles appear in the first stage which disappear and are replaced by four
  radial tentacles in the second stage.</p>

  <p>As with many other groups of free-swimming marine animals the Trachomedusae have a very wide
  geographical distribution, and some genera may prove to be almost cosmopolitan, but the majority
  of the species appear to be characteristic of the warmer regions of the high seas. Sometimes they
  are found at the surface, but more usually they swim at a depth of a few fathoms to a hundred or
  more from the surface. The Pectyllidae appear to be confined to the bottom of the sea at great
  depths.</p>

  <p>The principal families of the Trachomedusae are:&mdash;</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Olindiidae.</b>&mdash;This family appears to be structurally and in development most
  closely related to the Leptomedusae, and is indeed regarded by Goto<a id="NtA_326"
  href="#Nt_326"><sup>[326]</sup></a> as closely related to the Eucopidae in that order. They have
  two sets of tentacles, velar and exumbrellar; the statocysts are numerous, two on each side of the
  exumbrellar tentacles. Radial canals four or six. Manubrium well developed and quadrate, with
  distinct lips. There is an adhesive disc on each exumbrellar tentacle.</p>

  <p>Genera: <i>Olindias</i>, <i>Olindioides</i>, <i>Gonionema</i> (Fig. 139), and
  <i>Halicalyx</i>.</p>

  <p>As in other families of Medusae the distribution of the genera is very wide. <i>Olindias
  m&uuml;lleri</i> occurs in the Mediterranean, <i>Olindioides formosa</i> off the coast of Japan,
  <i>Gonionema murbachii</i> is found in abundance in the eel pond at Wood's Holl, United States of
  America, and <i>Halicalyx</i> off Florida.</p>

  <p>Two genera may be referred to in this place, although their <span class="pagenum"
  id="page292"><span class="smaller">{292}</span></span>systematic position in relation to each
  other and to other Medusae has not been satisfactorily determined.</p>

  <p><i>Limnocodium sowerbyi</i> is a small Medusa that was first discovered in the <i>Victoria
  regia</i> tanks in the Botanic Gardens, Regent's Park, London, in the year 1880. It has lately
  made its appearance in the <i>Victoria regia</i> tank in the Parc de la B&ecirc;te d'Or at Lyons.<a
  id="NtA_327" href="#Nt_327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> As it was, at the time of its discovery, the only
  fresh-water jelly-fish known, it excited considerable interest, and this interest was not
  diminished when the peculiarities of its structure were described by Lankester and others. It has
  a rather flattened umbrella, with entire margin and numerous marginal tentacles, the manubrium is
  long, quadrate, and has four distinct lips. There are four radial canals, and the male gonads (all
  the specimens discovered were of the male sex) are sac-like bodies on the sub-umbrellar aspect of
  the middle points of the four radial canals. In these characters the genus shows general
  affinities with the Olindiidae. The difficult question of the origin of the statoliths from the
  primary germ layers of the embryo and some other points in the minute anatomy of the Medusa have
  <span class="pagenum" id="page293"><span class="smaller">{293}</span></span>suggested the view
  that <i>Limnocodium</i> is not properly placed in any of the other orders. Goto,<a id="NtA_328"
  href="#Nt_328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> however, in a recent paper, confirms the view of the
  affinities of <i>Limnocodium</i> with the Olindiidae.</p>

  <p>The life-history of <i>Limnocodium</i> is not known, but a curious Hydroid form attached to
  <i>Pontederia</i> roots was found in the same tank as the Medusae, and this in all probability
  represents the hydrosome stage of its development. The Medusae are formed apparently by a process
  of transverse fission of the Hydroid stock<a id="NtA_329" href="#Nt_329"><sup>[329]</sup></a>
  similar in some respects to that observed in the production of certain Acraspedote Medusae. This
  is quite unlike the asexual mode of formation of Medusae in any other Craspedote form. The
  structure of this hydrosome is, moreover, very different to that of any other Hydroid, and
  consequently the relations of the genus with the Trachomedusae cannot be regarded as very
  close.</p>

  <p><i>Limnocodium</i> has only been found in the somewhat artificial conditions of the tanks in
  botanical gardens, and its native locality is not known, but its association with the <i>Victoria
  regia</i> water-lily seems to indicate that its home is in tropical South America.</p>

  <p><i>Limnocnida tanganyicae</i> is another remarkable fresh-water Medusa, about seven-eights of
  an inch in diameter, found in the lakes Tanganyika and Victoria Nyanza of Central Africa.<a
  id="NtA_330" href="#Nt_330"><sup>[330]</sup></a> It differs from <i>Limnocodium</i> in having a
  short collar-like manubrium with a large round mouth two-thirds the diameter of the umbrella, and
  in several other not unimportant particulars. It produces in May and June a large number of
  Medusa-buds by gemmation on the manubrium, and in August and September the sexual organs are
  formed in the same situation.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The fixed hydrosome stage, if such a stage occurs in the life-history, has not been discovered;
  but Mr. Moore<a id="NtA_331" href="#Nt_331"><sup>[331]</sup></a> believes that <span
  class="pagenum" id="page294"><span class="smaller">{294}</span></span>the development is direct
  from ciliated planulae to the Medusae. The occurrence of <i>Limnocnida</i> in Lake Tanganyika is
  supposed by the same authority to afford a strong support to the view that this lake represents
  the remnants of a sea which in Jurassic times spread over part of the African continent. This
  theory has, however, been adversely criticised from several sides.<a id="NtA_332"
  href="#Nt_332"><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The character of the manubrium and the position of the sexual cells suggest that
  <i>Limnocnida</i> has affinities with the Narcomedusae or Anthomedusae, but the marginal
  sense-organs and the number and position of the tentacles, showing considerable similarity with
  those of <i>Limnocodium</i>, justify the more convenient plan of placing the two genera in the
  same family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Petasidae.</b>&mdash;The genus <i>Petasus</i> is a small Medusa with four radial
  canals, four gonads, four tentacles, and four free marginal statorhabs. A few other genera
  associated with <i>Petasus</i> show simple characters as regards the canals and the marginal
  organs, but as very little is known of any of the genera the family may be regarded as provisional
  only. <i>Petasus</i> is found in the Mediterranean and off the Canaries.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Trachynemidae.</b>&mdash;In this family there are eight radial canals, and the
  statorhabs are sunk into a marginal vesicle. <i>Trachynema</i>, characterised by its very long
  manubrium, is a not uncommon Medusa of the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Many of
  the species are small, but <i>T. funerarium</i> has sometimes a disc two inches in diameter.
  <i>Homoconema</i> and <i>Pentachogon</i> have numerous very short tentacles.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Pectyllidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains a few deep-sea species with characters
  similar to those of the preceding family, but the tentacles are provided with terminal suckers.
  <i>Pectyllis</i> is found in the Atlantic Ocean at depths of over 1000 fathoms.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Aglauridae.</b>&mdash;The radial canals are eight in number and the statorhabs are
  usually free. In the manubrium there is a rod-like projection of the mesogloea from the aboral
  wall of the gastric cavity, covered by a thin epithelium of endoderm, which occupies a
  considerable portion of the lumen of the manubrium. This organ may be called the tongue.
  <i>Aglaura</i> has an octagonal umbrella, and a manubrium which does not project beyond the velum.
  It occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page295"><span class="smaller">{295}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. Geryoniidae.</b>&mdash;In this family there are four or six radial canals, the
  statorhabs are sunk in the mesogloea, and a tongue is present in the manubrium. <i>Liriope</i>
  (Fig. 137) is sometimes as much as three inches in diameter. It has a very long manubrium, and the
  tongue sometimes projects beyond the mouth. There are four very long radial tentacles. It is found
  in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Pacific and Indian Oceans. <i>Geryonia</i>
  has a wider geographical distribution than <i>Liriope</i>, and is sometimes four inches in
  diameter. It differs from <i>Liriope</i> in having six, or a multiple of six, radial canals.
  <i>Carmarina</i> of the Mediterranean and other seas becomes larger even than <i>Geryonia</i>,
  from which it differs in the arrangement of the centripetal canals.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Liriantha appendiculata</i> sometimes occurs on the south coast of England
  during September, October, or at other times.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order VIII. Narcomedusae.</b></p>

  <p>The Narcomedusae differ from the Trachomedusae in having the margin of the umbrella divided
  into a number of lobes, and in bearing the gonads on the sub-umbrellar wall of the gastral cavity
  instead of upon the radial canals. The tentacles are situated at some little distance from the
  margin of the umbrella at points on the aboral surface corresponding with the angles between the
  umbrella lobes. Between the base of the tentacle and the marginal angle there is a tract of
  modified epithelium called the "peronium." The manubrium is usually short, and the mouth leads
  into an expanded gastral chamber which is provided with lobular diverticula reaching as far as the
  bases of the tentacles. The marginal sense-organs are in the form of unprotected statorhabs. Very
  little is known concerning the life-history of any of the Narcomedusae. In <i>Cunoctantha
  octonaria</i> the peculiar ciliated larva with two tentacles and a very long proboscis soon
  develops two more tentacles and creeps into the bell of the Anthomedusan <i>Turritopsis</i>,
  where, attached by its tentacles, it lives a parasitic life. Before being converted into a Medusa
  it gives rise by gemmation to a number of similar individuals, all of which become, in time,
  Medusae. The parasitic stage is often regarded as the representative of the hydrosome stage
  reduced and adapted to the oceanic habit of the adult.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page296"><span class="smaller">{296}</span></span></div>

  <p>In <i>Cunina proboscidea</i>, and in some other species, a very remarkable method of
  reproduction has been described by Metschnikoff, called by him "sporogony." In these cases young
  sexual cells (male or female) wander from the gonad of the parent into the mesogloea of the
  umbrella, where they develop parthenogenetically into ciliated morulae. These escape by the radial
  canals into the gastric cavity, and there form a stolon from which young Medusae are formed by
  gemmation. In <i>C. proboscidea</i> these young Medusae are like the genus <i>Solmaris</i>, but in
  <i>C. rhododactyla</i> they have the form of the parent. In some cases the ciliated larvae leave
  the parent altogether and become attached to a <i>Geryonia</i> or some other Medusa, where they
  form the stolon.</p>

  <p>This very interesting method of reproduction cannot be regarded as a primitive one, and throws
  no light on the origin of the order. It might be regarded as a further stage in the degeneration
  of the hydrosome stage in its adaptation to a parasitic existence.</p>

  <p>The Narcomedusae have a wide geographical distribution. Species of <i>Aeginopsis</i> occur in
  the White Sea and Bering Strait, but the genera are more characteristic of warmer waters. Some
  species occur in moderately deep water, and <i>Cunarcha</i> was found in 1675 fathoms off the
  Canaries, but they are more usually found at or near the surface of the sea.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Cunanthidae.</b>&mdash;Narcomedusae with large gastral diverticula corresponding in
  position with the bases of the tentacles. <i>Cunina</i> and <i>Cunoctantha</i>, occurring in the
  Mediterranean and in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, belong to this family. In <i>Cunina</i> the
  tentacles may be eight in number, or some multiple of four between eight and twenty-four. In
  <i>Cunoctantha</i> the number of tentacles appears to be constantly eight.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Peganthidae.</b>&mdash;There appear to be no gastral pouches in this family. The
  species of <i>Pegantha</i> are found at depths of about 80 fathoms in the Indian and Pacific
  Oceans.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Aeginidae.</b>&mdash;The large gastral pouches of this family alternate with the bases
  of the tentacles. <i>Aegina</i> occurs in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. <i>Aeginopsis.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. Solmaridae.</b>&mdash;In this family the gastral pouches are variable,
  sometimes corresponding with, sometimes alternating with, the bases of the tentacles. The circular
  canal is represented <span class="pagenum" id="page297"><span
  class="smaller">{297}</span></span>in some genera by solid cords of endoderm. <i>Solmaris</i>
  sometimes appears in the English Channel, but it is probably a wanderer from the warmer regions of
  the Atlantic Ocean. It is found in abundance during November on the west coast of Ireland.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order IX. Siphonophora.</b></p>

  <p>In this order the naturalist finds collected together a number of very beautiful, delicate
  transparent organisms to which the general term "jelly-fish" may be applied, although their
  organisation is far more complicated and difficult to describe than that of any of the Medusae. In
  several of the Hydrozoa the phenomenon of dimorphism has already been noticed. In these cases one
  set of individuals in a colony performs functions of stinging and catching food and another the
  functions of devouring and digesting it. In many of the Siphonophora there appears to be a colony
  of individuals in which the division of labour is carried to a much further extent than it is in
  the dimorphic Hydrozoa referred to above. Not only are there specialised gastrozooids and
  dactylozooids, but also gonozooids, zooids for propelling the colony through the water
  ("nectocalyces"), protective zooids ("hydrophyllia"), and in some cases a specialised zooid for
  hydrostatic functions; the whole forming a swimming or floating polymorphic colony. But this
  conception of the construction of the Siphonophora is not the only one that has met with support.
  By some zoologists the Siphonophoran body is regarded not as a colony of individuals, but as a
  single individual in which the various organs have become multiplied and dislocated.</p>

  <p>The multiplication or repetition of organs that are usually single in each individual is not
  unknown in other Hydrozoa. In the Medusa of the Gymnoblast <i>Syncoryne</i>, usually known as
  <i>Sarsia</i>, for example, there is sometimes a remarkable proliferation of the manubrium, and
  specimens have been found with three or four long manubria attached by a tubular stalk to the
  centre of the umbrella. Moreover, this complex of manubria may become detached from the umbrella
  and live for a considerable time an independent existence.<a id="NtA_333"
  href="#Nt_333"><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If we regard the manubrium of a Medusa as an organ of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page298"><span class="smaller">{298}</span></span>animal's body, it might be thought obvious
  that the phenomenon observed in the Medusae of <i>Syncoryne</i> is a case of a simple repetition
  of the parts of an individual; but the power that the group of manubria possesses of leading an
  independent existence renders its interpretation as a group of organs a matter of some
  inconvenience. If we can conceive the idea that an organ may become detached and lead an
  independent existence, there is no reason why we should not regard the Medusa itself of
  <i>Syncoryne</i> as an organ, and we should be driven to the paradoxical conclusion that, as
  regards several genera and families of Hydrozoa, we know nothing at present of the individuals,
  but only of their free-swimming organs, and that in others the individual has degenerated,
  although one of its organs remains.</p>

  <p>There is, however, no convincing argument to support either the conception that the
  Siphonophoran body is a colony of individuals, or that it is an individual with disjointed organs.
  These two conceptions are sometimes called the "Poly-person" and "Poly-organ" theories
  respectively. The difficulty is caused by the impossibility of giving any satisfactory definition
  in the case of the Hydrozoa of the biological terms "organ" and "individual." In the higher
  animals, where the correlation of parts is far more complex and essential than it is in
  Coelenterata, a defined limit to the scope of these terms can be laid down, but in the lower
  animals the conception of what is termed an organ merges into that which is called an individual,
  and no definite boundary line between the two exists in Nature. The difficulty is therefore a
  permanent one, and, in using the expression "colony" for the Siphonophoran body, it must be
  understood that it is used for convenience' sake rather than because it represents the only
  correct conception of the organisation of these remarkable Coelenterates.</p>

  <p>Regarding the Siphonophora as polymorphic colonies, then, the following forms of zooids may be
  found.</p>

  <p><i>Nectocalyces.</i>&mdash;The nectocalyces are in the form of the umbrella of a medusa
  attached to the stolon of the colony by the aboral pole. They are provided with a velum and,
  usually, four radial canals and a circular canal. There is no manubrium, and the marginal
  tentacles and sense-organs are rudimentary or absent. There may be one or more nectocalyces in
  each colony, <span class="pagenum" id="page299"><span class="smaller">{299}</span></span>and their
  function is, by rhythmic contractions, to propel the colony through the water (Fig. 142, N).</p>

  <p><i>Gastrozooids.</i>&mdash;These are tubular or saccular zooids provided with a mouth and
  attached by their aboral extremity to the stolon (Fig. 142, G). In some cases the aboral region of
  the zooid is differentiated as a stomach. It is dilated and bears the digestive cells, the oral
  extremity or hypostome being narrower and more transparent. In some cases the mouth is a simple
  round aperture at the extremity of the hypostome, but in others it is dilated to form a
  trumpet-like lip.</p>

  <p><i>Dactylozooids</i>.&mdash;In <i>Velella</i> and <i>Porpita</i> the dactylozooids are similar
  in general characters to the tentacles of many Medusae. They are arranged as a frill round the
  margin of the colony, and each consists of a simple tube of ectoderm and endoderm terminating in a
  knobbed extremity richly provided with nematocysts.</p>

  <p>In many other Siphonophora, however, the dactylozooids are very long and elaborate filaments,
  which extend for a great distance from the colony into the sea. They reach their most elaborate
  condition in the Calycophorae.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig141.jpg"><img style="width:33%" src="images/fig141.jpg" alt="fig141"
    title="fig141" ></a>
    <div class="smaller aj">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 141.</span>&mdash;A small Crustacean
      (<i>Rhinocalanus</i>) caught by a terminal filament (<i>f.t</i>) of a battery of
      <i>Stephanophyes</i>. <i>b</i>, The proximal end of the battery with the most powerful
      nematocysts; <i>e</i>, elastic band; <i>S</i>, stalk supporting the battery on the
      dactylozooid. (After Chun.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The dactylozooid in these forms has a hollow axis, and the lumen is continuous with the cavity
  of the neighbouring gastrozooid. Arranged at regular intervals on the axis is a series of
  tentacles ("tentilla"), and each of these supports <span class="pagenum" id="page300"><span
  class="smaller">{300}</span></span>a kidney-shaped swelling, the "cnidosac," or battery, which is
  sometimes protected by a hood. Each battery contains an enormous number of nematocysts. In
  <i>Stephanophyes</i>, for example, there are about 1700 nematocysts of four different kinds in
  each battery. At the extremity of the battery there is a delicate terminal filament. The action of
  the battery in <i>Stephanophyes</i> is, according to Chun,<a id="NtA_334"
  href="#Nt_334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> a very complicated one. The terminal filament lassos the prey
  and discharges its somewhat feeble nematocysts at it (Fig. 141). If this kills it, the
  dactylozooid contracts and passes the prey to a gastrozooid. If the animal continues its
  struggles, it is drawn up to the distal end of the battery and receives the discharge of a large
  number of nematocysts; and if this also fails to put an end to its life, a membrane covering the
  largest and most powerful nematocysts at the proximal end of the whole battery is ruptured, and a
  final broadside of stinging threads is shot at it.</p>

  <p>The larger nematocysts of these batteries in the Siphonophora are among the largest found in
  Coelenterata, being from 0.5 to 0.1 mm. in length, and they are frequently capable of inflicting
  painful stings on the human skin. The species of <i>Physalia</i>, commonly called "Portuguese
  Men-of-War," have perhaps the worst reputation in this respect, the pain being not only intense
  but lasting a long time.</p>

  <p><i>Hydrophyllia.</i>&mdash;In many Siphonophora a number of short, mouthless, non-sexual zooids
  occur, which appear to have no other function than that of shielding or protecting other and more
  vital parts of the colony. They consist of an axis of firm mesogloea, covered by a layer of
  flattened ectoderm, and they may be finger-shaped or triangular in form. In <i>Agalma</i> and
  <i>Praya</i> an endoderm canal perforates the mesogloea and terminates in a little mouth at the
  free extremity. In <i>Athoria</i> and <i>Rhodophysa</i> the hydrophyllium terminates in a little
  nectocalyx.</p>

  <p><i>Pneumatophore.</i>&mdash;In all the Siphonophora, with the exception of the Calycophorae,
  there is found on one side or at one extremity of the colony a vesicle or bladder containing a
  gas,<a id="NtA_335" href="#Nt_335"><sup>[335]</sup></a> which serves as a float to support the
  colony in the water. <span class="pagenum" id="page301"><span
  class="smaller">{301}</span></span>This bladder or pneumatophore is probably in all cases a much
  modified nectocalyx. It shows great variations in size and structure in the group. It is sometimes
  relatively very large, as in <i>Physalia</i> and <i>Velella</i>, sometimes very small, as in
  <i>Physophora</i>. It is provided with an apical pore in some genera (<i>Rhizophysa</i>), or a
  basal pore in others (Auronectidae), but it is generally closed. In the many chambered
  pneumatophore of the Chondrophoridae there are several pores.</p>

  <p>In many forms two distinct parts of the pneumatophore can be recognised&mdash;a distal region
  lined by chitin,<a id="NtA_336" href="#Nt_336"><sup>[336]</sup></a> probably representing the
  sub-umbrellar cavity of the nectocalyx, and a small funnel-shaped region lined by an epithelium,
  the homology of which is a matter of dispute. It is believed that the gas is secreted by this
  epithelium. In the Auronectidae the region with secretory epithelium is relatively large and of a
  more complicated histological character. It is remarkable also that in this family the pore
  communicates, not with the chitin-lined region, but directly with the epithelium-lined region.</p>

  <p>There is no pneumatophore in the Calycophorae, but in this sub-order a diverticulum of an
  endoderm canal secretes a globule of oil which may serve the same hydrostatic function.</p>

  <p>The <i>stolon</i> is the common stem which supports the different zooids of the colony. In the
  Calycophorae the stolon is a long, delicate, and extremely contractile thread attached at one end
  to a nectocalyx, and bearing the zooids in discontinuous groups. These groups of zooids arranged
  at intervals on the stolon are called the "cormidia." The stolon is a tube with very thick walls.
  Its lumen is lined by a ciliated endoderm with circular muscular processes, and the surface is
  covered with an ectoderm, also provided with circular muscular processes. Between these two layers
  there is a relatively thick mesogloea showing on the outer side deep and compound folds and
  grooves supporting an elaborate system of longitudinal muscular fibres. In many Physonectidae the
  stolon is long and filamentous, but not so contractile as it is in Calycophorae, but in others it
  is much reduced in length and relatively stouter. The reduction <span class="pagenum"
  id="page302"><span class="smaller">{302}</span></span>in length of the stolon is accompanied by a
  complication of structure, the simple tubular condition being replaced by a spongy complex of
  tubes covered by a common sheath of ectoderm. In the Auronectidae the stolon is represented by a
  conical or hemispherical spongy mass bearing the zooids, and in the Rhizophysaliidae and
  Chondrophoridae it becomes a disc or ribbon-shaped pad spreading over the under side of the
  pneumatophore.</p>

  <p><i>Gonozooids.</i>&mdash;The gonozooids are simple tubular processes attached to the stolon
  which bear the Medusae or the degenerate medusiform gonophores. In the Chondrophoridae the
  gonozooids possess a mouth, but in most Siphonophora they have neither mouth nor tentacles. In
  some cases, such as <i>Anthophysa</i>, the colonies are bisexual&mdash;the male and female
  gonophores being borne by separate gonozooids&mdash;but in others (e.g. <i>Physalia</i>) the
  colonies appear to be unisexual.</p>

  <p>As a general rule the gonophores of Siphonophora do not escape from the parent colony as
  free-swimming Medusae, but an exception occurs in <i>Velella</i>, which produces a number of small
  free-swimming Medusae formerly described by Gegenbaur under the generic name <i>Chrysomitra</i>.
  This Medusa has a velum, a single tentacle, eight to sixteen radial canals, and it bears the
  gonads on the short manubrium. The Medusa of <i>Velella</i> has, in fact, the essential characters
  of the Anthomedusae.</p>

  <p>Our knowledge of the life-history of the Siphonophora is very incomplete, but there are
  indications, from scattered observations, that in some genera, at least, it may be very
  complicated.</p>

  <p>The fertilised ovum of <i>Velella</i> gives rise to a planula which sinks to the bottom of the
  sea, and changes into a remarkable larva known as the <i>Conaria</i> larva. This larva was
  discovered by Woltereck<a id="NtA_337" href="#Nt_337"><sup>[337]</sup></a> at depths of 600-1000
  metres in great numbers. It is very delicate and transparent, but the endoderm is red (the colour
  so characteristic of animals inhabiting deep water), and it may be regarded as essentially a
  deep-sea larva. The larva rises to the surface and changes into the form known as the
  <i>Ratarula</i> larva, which has a simple one-chambered pneumatophore containing a gas, and a
  rudiment of the sail. In contrast to the <i>Conaria</i>, the <i>Ratarula</i> is blue in colour.
  With the development of the zooids on the under side of this <span class="pagenum"
  id="page303"><span class="smaller">{303}</span></span>larva (<i>i.e.</i> the side opposite to the
  pneumatophore), a definite octoradial symmetry is shown, there being for some time eight
  dactylozooids and eight definite folds in the wall of the pneumatophore. This octoradial symmetry,
  however, is soon lost as the number of folds in the pneumatophore and the number of tentacles
  increase.</p>

  <p>It is probable that in the Siphonophora, as in many other Coelenterata, the production of
  sexual cells by an individual is no sign that its life-history is completed. There may possibly be
  two or more phases of life in which sexual maturity is reached.</p>

  <p>An example of a complicated life-history is found in the Calycophoran species <i>Muggiaea
  kochii</i>. The embryo gives rise to a form with a single nectocalyx which is like a
  <i>Monophyes</i>, and this by the budding of a second nectocalyx produces a form that has a
  remarkable resemblance to a <i>Diphyes</i>, but the primary nectocalyx degenerates and is cast
  off, while the secondary one assumes the characters of the single <i>Muggiaea</i> nectocalyx. The
  stolon of the <i>Muggiaea</i> produces a series of cormidia, and as the sexual cells of the
  cormidia develop, a special nectocalyx is formed at the base of each one of them, and the group of
  zooids is detached as an independent colony, formerly known as <i>Eudoxia eschscholtzii</i>. In a
  similar manner the cormidia of <i>Doramasia picta</i> give rise to the sexual free-swimming
  monogastric forms, known by the name <i>Ersaea picta</i> (Fig. 142). In these cases it seems
  possible that the production of ripe sexual cells is confined to the <i>Eudoxia</i> and
  <i>Ersaea</i> stages respectively, but it is probable that in other species the cormidia do not
  break off from the stolon, or may escape only from the older colonies.</p>

  <p>The Siphonophora are essentially free-swimming pelagic <span class="pagenum" id="page304"><span
  class="smaller">{304}</span></span>organisms. Some of them (Auronectidae) appear to have become
  adapted to a deep-sea habit, others are usually found in intermediate waters, but the majority
  occur with the pelagic plankton at or very near the surface of the open sea. Although the order
  may be said to be cosmopolitan in its distribution, the Siphonophora are only found in great
  numbers and variety in the sub-tropical and tropical zones. In the temperate and arctic zones they
  are relatively rare, but <i>Galeolaria biloba</i> and <i>Physophora borealis</i> appear to be true
  northern forms. The only British species are <i>Muggiaea atlantica</i> and <i>Cupulita sarsii</i>.
  <i>Velella spirans</i> occasionally drifts from the Atlantic on to our western shores, and
  sometimes great numbers of the pneumatophores of this species may be found cast up on the beach.
  <i>Diphyes</i> sp., <i>Physalia</i> sp., and <i>Physophora borealis</i> are also occasionally
  brought to the British shores by the Gulf Stream.</p>

  <p>The Calycophorae are usually perfectly colourless and transparent, with the exception of the
  oil-globule in the oleocyst, which is yellow or orange in colour. Many of the other Siphonophora,
  however, are of a transparent, deep indigo blue colour, similar to that of many other components
  of the plankton.</p>

  <p>Most of the Siphonophora, although, strictly speaking, surface animals, are habitually
  submerged; the large pneumatophores of <i>Velella</i> and <i>Physalia</i>, however, project above
  the surface, and these animals are therefore frequently drifted by the prevailing wind into large
  shoals, or blown ashore. At Mentone, on the Mediterranean, <i>Velella</i> is sometimes drifted
  into the harbour in countless numbers. Agassiz mentions the lines of deep blue Velellas drifted
  ashore on the coast of Florida; and a small species of blue <i>Physalia</i> may often be seen in
  long lines on the shore of some of the islands of the Malay Archipelago.</p>

  <p>The food of most of the Siphonophora consists of small Crustacea and other minute organisms,
  but some of the larger forms are capable of catching and devouring fish. It is stated by Bigelow<a
  id="NtA_338" href="#Nt_338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> that a big <i>Physalia</i> will capture and
  devour a full-grown Mackerel. The manner in which it feeds is described as follows:&mdash;"It
  floats on the sea, quietly waiting for some heedless individual to bump its head against one of
  the tentacles. The fish, on striking, is stung by the nettle-cells, and fastened probably by them
  to the tentacle. Trying to run away the fish pulls on the <span class="pagenum" id="page305"><span
  class="smaller">{305}</span></span>tentacle. The tension on its peduncle thus produced acts as a
  stimulus on apparently some centre there which causes it to contract. The fish in this way is
  drawn up so that it touches the sticky mouths of the squirming siphons [<i>i.e.</i> gastrozooids].
  As soon as the mouths, covered as they are with a gluey substance and provided with nettle-cells,
  touch the fish they stick fast, a few at first, and gradually more. The mouths open, and their
  lips are spread out over the fish until they touch, so that by the time he is dead the fish is
  enclosed in a tight bag composed of the lips of a dozen or more siphon mouths. Here the fish is
  digested. As it begins to disintegrate partially digested fragments are taken into the stomachs of
  the attached siphons (gastrozooids). When they have become gorged they detach themselves from the
  remains of the fish, the process of digestion is completed in the stomachs, and the nutrient fluid
  is distributed...."</p>

  <p class="sp3">In consequence of the very unsatisfactory state of our knowledge of the
  life-history of the Siphonophora the classification of the order is a matter of unusual
  difficulty.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order I. Calycophorae.</b></p>

  <p>The character which distinguishes this sub-order is the absence of a pneumatophore.</p>

  <p>The colony usually consists of a long, slender, contractile stolon, provided at one end with
  one, two, or several nectocalyces. Upon the stolon are arranged several groups ("cormidia") of
  polymorphic zooids.</p>

  <p>The nectocalyces have a well-developed velum, four radial canals, and a muscular umbrella-wall.
  A special peculiarity of the nectocalyx of this sub-order is a diverticulum (oleocyst) from one of
  the radial canals, containing a coloured globule of oil. The function of this oil-globule is
  probably similar to that of the pneumatophore, and assists the muscular efforts of the
  nectocalyces in keeping the colony afloat. One of the nectocalyces of each colony exhibits on one
  side a deep ectodermic fold, which is frequently converted into a pit. At the bottom of this pit
  is attached the end of the stolon, the whole of which with its numerous cormidia can be withdrawn
  into the shelter of the pit when danger threatens. The cormidia consist of at least four <span
  class="pagenum" id="page306"><span class="smaller">{306}</span></span>kinds of zooids: a
  gastrozooid with a trumpet-shaped mouth armed with nematocysts, a long dactylozooid provided with
  a series of tentilla, and a rudimentary gonozooid bearing numbers of male or female medusiform
  gonophores. These three kinds of zooids are partially covered and protected by a bent
  shield-shaped phyllozooid or hydrophyllium.</p>

  <p>Each of the cormidia is unisexual, but the colony as a whole is usually hermaphrodite, the male
  and female cormidia regularly alternating, or the male cormidia being arranged on the
  nectocalycine half and the female cormidia on the opposite half of the stolon.</p>

  <p>The families of the Calycophorae are:&mdash;</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Monophyidae.</b>&mdash;In this family there is a single conical or mitre-shaped
  nectocalyx. The cormidia become detached as free-swimming <i>Eudoxia</i> or <i>Ersaea</i>
  forms.</p>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 1. <span class="sc">Sphaeronectinae.</span>&mdash;The primary nectocalyx persists
  throughout life&mdash;<i>Monophyes</i> and <i>Sphaeronectes</i>.</p>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 2. <span class="sc">Cymbonectinae.</span>&mdash;The primary nectocalyx is thrown off,
  and is replaced by a secondary and permanent nectocalyx&mdash;<i>Cymbonectes</i>, <i>Muggiaea</i>,
  and <i>Doramasia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Diphyidae.</b>&mdash;The primary mitre-shaped nectocalyx is thrown off and replaced
  by two secondary rounded, prismatic, or pyramidal, heteromorphic nectocalyces.</p>

  <p>This family contains several sub-families, which are arranged in two groups: the Diphyidae
  Oppositae, in which the two secondary bells are opposite one another, and do not exhibit
  pronounced ridges; and the Diphyidae Superpositae, in which one of the two secondary nectocalyces
  is situated in front of the other, and each nectocalyx is provided externally with very definite
  and often wing-like ridges. In all the Diphyidae Oppositae the cormidia remain attached, whereas
  in most of the Diphyidae Superpositae they become free-swimming, as in the Monophyidae.</p>

  <p>The sub-families of the <b>Diphyidae Oppositae</b> are<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 1. <span class="sc">Amphicaryoninae.</span>&mdash;One of the two secondary
  nectocalyces becomes flattened above to form a shield, and at the same time its sub-umbrellar
  cavity is atrophied, and its radial canals reduced. <i>Mitrophyes</i>, Atlantic Ocean.</p>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 2. <span class="sc">Prayinae.</span>&mdash;The colony exhibits a pair of large, obtuse
  nectocalyces, with a relatively small sub-umbrellar cavity. <i>Praya</i>, Mediterranean and
  Atlantic.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page307"><span class="smaller">{307}</span></span></div>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 3. <span class="sc">Desmophyinae.</span>&mdash;The colony bears a large number of
  reserve or tertiary nectocalyces arranged in two rows. <i>Desmophyes</i>, Indian Ocean.</p>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 4. <span class="sc">Stephanophyinae.</span>&mdash;There are four nectocalyces arranged
  in a horizontal plane. Each one of the cormidia bears a nectocalyx, which is periodically
  replaced. This sub-family is constituted for <i>Stephanophyes superba</i> from the Canary Islands.
  It attains a length of 25 cm., and is probably the largest and most beautiful of all the
  Calycophoridae.<a id="NtA_339" href="#Nt_339"><sup>[339]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The group <b>Diphyidae Superpositae</b> contains the following<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 1. <span class="sc">Galeolarinae.</span>&mdash;<i>Galeolaria.</i></p>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 2. <span class="sc">Diphyopsinae.</span>&mdash;<i>Diphyes.</i></p>

  <p>Sub-Fam. 3. <span class="sc">Abylinae.</span>&mdash;<i>Abyla.</i></p>

  <p>These sub-families differ from one another in the character and shape of the nectocalyces and
  in other characters. They have a world-wide distribution, <i>Diphyes</i> and <i>Galeolaria</i>
  extending north into the Arctic Seas. <i>Diphyes</i> is British.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Polyphyidae.</b>&mdash;The nectocalyces are numerous, and superposed in two rows.
  The cormidia remain attached.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The family contains the genera <i>Polyphyes</i> and <i>Hippopodius</i>, both
  probably cosmopolitan in warm waters.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order II. Physophorae.</b></p>

  <p>In this sub-order the primary nectocalyx gives rise to a definite pneumatophore. There are four
  families.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Physonectidae.</b>&mdash;In this, the largest family of the sub-order, there is a
  monothalamic pneumatophore supporting a stolon, which in some forms is of great length, but in
  others is reduced to a stump or pad, on which there are usually found several nectocalyces,
  hydrophyllia, gastrozooids, gonozooids, and tentilla.</p>

  <p>The principal sub-families are:&mdash;</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Agalminae.</span>&mdash;With a long stolon, bearing at the upper end
  (<i>i.e.</i> the end next to the pneumatophore) two rows of nectocalyces. The other zooids are
  arranged in cormidia on the stolon, each covered by a hydrophyllium. Dactylozooids with tentilla.
  <i>Agalma</i> and <i>Cupulita</i>, Mediterranean Sea.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Apoleminae.</span>&mdash;Similar to the above, but without tentilla. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page308"><span class="smaller">{308}</span></span><i>Apolemia</i>&mdash;this
  genus attains a length of two or three metres. Mediterranean Sea. <i>Dicymba</i>, Indian
  Ocean.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Physophorinae.</span>&mdash;The pneumatophore larger in proportion than it is
  in the preceding families. The stolon is short, and bears rows of nectocalyces at the upper end.
  The gastrozooids, dactylozooids, and gonozooids are arranged in verticils on the lower expanded
  part of the stolon. Hydrophyllia absent. <i>Physophora</i>, cosmopolitan in the areas of warm sea
  water.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Auronectidae.</b>&mdash;The pneumatophore is large. The stolon is reduced to a
  spongy mass of tissue on the under side of the pneumatophore, and this bears numerous cormidia
  arranged in a helicoid spiral. Projecting from the base of the pneumatophore there is a peculiar
  organ called the "aurophore," provided with an apical pore. This organ has been described as a
  specially modified nectocalyx, but it is probably a specialised development of the
  epithelium-lined portion of the pneumatophore of other Physophorae. The Auronectidae are found
  only at considerable depths, 300 to 1400 fathoms, and are probably specially adapted to that
  habitat. <i>Rhodalia</i>, <i>Stephalia</i>, Atlantic Ocean.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Rhizophysaliidae.</b>&mdash;The pneumatophore is large, or very large, in this
  family. The zooids are arranged in horizontal rows on the under side of the pneumatophore
  (<i>Physalia</i>), or in a helicoid spiral on a short stolon (<i>Epibulia</i>). There are no
  nectocalyces nor hydrophyllia.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Physalia</i> is the notorious "Portuguese Man-of-War." The pneumatophore is a
  large bladder-like vesicle, sometimes attaining a length of 12 cm. One species described by
  Haeckel under the generic name <i>Caravella</i> has a pneumatophore 30 cm. and more in length, and
  dactylozooids attaining a length of 20 metres. It is a curious fact that only the male colonies of
  <i>Physalia</i> are known, and it is suggested that the female may have quite a different form.<a
  id="NtA_340" href="#Nt_340"><sup>[340]</sup></a> <i>Epibulia</i> has a much smaller bladder than
  <i>Physalia</i>. Both genera have a cosmopolitan distribution at the surface of the warm seas.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Chondrophoridae.</b>&mdash;This family stands quite by itself in the sub-order
  Physophorae, and is placed in a separate division of the sub-order by Chun, who gives it the name
  <span class="sc">Tracheophysa</span>. The essential distinguishing characters of the family are
  <span class="pagenum" id="page309"><span class="smaller">{309}</span></span>the large polythalamic
  pneumatophore and the single large central gastrozooid.</p>

  <p>The colony is disc-shaped, and has a superficial resemblance to a Medusa. On the upper side is
  the flattened pneumatophore, covered by a fold of tissue continuous with that at the edge of the
  disc. In <i>Velella</i> a vertical triangular sail or crest rises from the upper side, but this is
  absent in <i>Porpita</i>.</p>

  <p>The mouth of the gastrozooid opens into a large digestive cavity, and between this and the
  under surface of the pneumatophore there is a glandular spongy tissue called the liver. The liver
  extends over the whole of the under side of the pneumatophore, and sends processes round the edge
  of the disc into the tissues of its upper surface. Intimately associated with the liver, and
  penetrating its interstices, is an organ which appears to be entirely composed of nematocysts,
  derived from the ectoderm, and called the central organ. At the margin of the disc there is a
  fringe of simple digitiform dactylozooids, and between the dactylozooids and the centrally placed
  gastrozooid are numerous gonozooids. Each of the gonozooids is provided with a distinct mouth, and
  bears the gonophores, which escape before the ripening of the gonads as the free-swimming Medusae
  called <i>Chrysomitra</i>. The pneumatophore consists of a number of annular chambers arranged in
  a concentric manner round the central original chamber formed from a modified zooid. These annular
  chambers are in communication with one another, and have each two pores (pneumatopyles) opening
  above to the exterior. The most remarkable feature, however, of the system is a series of fine
  branching tubes ("tracheae"), which pass from the annular chambers of the pneumatophore downwards
  into the hepatic mass and ramify there.</p>

  <p>There are two well-known genera: <i>Velella</i> with a sail, and <i>Porpita</i> without a sail.
  They are both found at the surface of the warmer regions of the great oceans and in the
  Mediterranean. <i>Velella</i> sometimes drifts on to British coasts from the Atlantic.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The genus <i>Discalia</i> has a much more simple octoradial structure. It was found
  at depths of 2600 and 2750 fathoms in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

  <h3 class="ac" title="Chapter XII. Scyphozoa" style="margin-bottom:3.4ex;"><span
  class="larger">CHAPTER XII</span></h3>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">COELENTERATA
  (<i>CONTINUED</i>): SCYPHOZOA = SCYPHOMEDUSAE</span></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS II. SCYPHOZOA = SCYPHOMEDUSAE</p>

  <p>The Scyphozoa are jelly-fishes, usually found floating at or near the surface of the sea. A few
  forms (Stauromedusae) are attached to rocks and weeds by a stalked prolongation of the aboral
  region of the umbrella. With this exception, however, they are all, in the adult stage, of the
  Medusa type of structure, having a bell-shaped or discoid umbrella, from the under surface of
  which depends a manubrium bearing the mouth or (in Rhizostomata) the numerous mouths.</p>

  <p>Although many of the species do not exceed an inch or a few inches in diameter, others attain a
  very great size, and it is among the Scyphozoa that we find the largest individual zooids of the
  Coelenterata. Some Discophora have a disc three or four feet in diameter, and one specimen
  obtained by the Antarctic Expedition of 1898-1900 weighed 90 lbs.<a id="NtA_341"
  href="#Nt_341"><sup>[341]</sup></a> The common jelly-fish, <i>Aurelia</i>, of our coasts belongs
  to a species that appears to be very variable in general characters as well as in size. Specimens
  obtained by the "Siboga" in the Malay Archipelago ranged from 6 to 64 cm. in diameter. The colour
  is very variable, shades of green, blue, brown, and purple being conspicuous in many species; but
  a pale milky-blue tint is perhaps the most prevalent, the tissues being generally less transparent
  than they are in the Medusae of the Hydrozoa. The colour of the Cubomedusae is usually yellow or
  brown, but <i>Charybdea xaymacana</i> is colourless and transparent. The deep-sea species,
  particularly the Periphyllidae, have usually an opaque brown or dark red colour. The
  surface-swimming <span class="pagenum" id="page311"><span
  class="smaller">{311}</span></span>forms, such as the common <i>Aurelia</i>, <i>Pelagia</i>,
  <i>Cyanaea</i>, are usually of a uniform pale milky-blue or green colour. Generally the colour is
  uniformly distributed, but sometimes the surface of the umbrella is freckled with irregular brown
  or yellow patches, as in <i>Dactylometra</i> and many others. There is frequently a special colour
  in the statorhabs which renders them conspicuous in the living jelly-fish, and the lips, or parts
  of the lips, of the manubrium have usually a different colour or tone to that of the umbrella.</p>

  <p>There is no reason to believe that the general colour of any of these jelly-fishes has either a
  protective or a warning significance. Nearly all the larger species, whether blue, green, or brown
  in colour, can be easily seen from a considerable distance, and the colours are not sufficiently
  bright or alarming to support the belief that they can serve the purpose of warning either fish or
  birds of the presence of a dangerous stinging animal. It is possible, however, that the brighter
  spots of colour that are often noticed on the tips of the tentacles and on the lips may act as a
  lure or bait in attracting small fish and Crustacea.</p>

  <p>Some of the Scyphozoa are phosphorescent, but it is a singular fact that there are very few
  recorded observations concerning the phosphorescence or the absence of it in most of the species.
  The pale blue light of <i>Pelagia noctiluca</i> or <i>P. phosphora</i> can be recognised from the
  deck of a ship in the open ocean, and they are often the most brilliant and conspicuous of the
  phosphorescent organisms.</p>

  <p>The food of the Scyphozoa varies a good deal. <i>Charybdea</i> and <i>Periphylla</i>, and
  probably many others with large mouths, will capture and ingest relatively large fish and
  Crustacea; but <i>Chrysaora isosceles</i><a id="NtA_342" href="#Nt_342"><sup>[342]</sup></a>
  apparently makes no attempt to capture either Copepoda or small fish, but preys voraciously upon
  Anthomedusae, Leptomedusae, Siphonophora, Ctenophora, and pelagic worms. Very little is known
  about the food of the Rhizostomata, but the small size of the mouths of these forms suggests that
  their food must also be of minute size. The frequent association of small fish with the larger
  jelly-fish is a matter of some interest that requires further investigation. In the North Sea
  young whiting are the constant guests of <i>Cyanaea capillata</i>.<a id="NtA_343"
  href="#Nt_343"><sup>[343]</sup></a> Over a <span class="pagenum" id="page312"><span
  class="smaller">{312}</span></span>hundred young horse-mackerel (<i>Caranx trachurus</i>) may be
  found sheltering under the umbrella of <i>Rhizostoma pulmo</i>. As the animal floats through the
  water the little fishes hover round the margin, but on the slightest alarm dart into the
  sub-umbrella cavity, and ultimately seek shelter in the sub-genital pits.<a id="NtA_344"
  href="#Nt_344"><sup>[344]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Two species of fish accompany the American Medusa <i>Dactylometra lactea</i>, one a Clupeoid,
  the other the young of the Butter-fish (<i>Stromateus triacanthus</i>). According to Agassiz and
  Mayer<a id="NtA_345" href="#Nt_345"><sup>[345]</sup></a> this is not an ordinary case of
  mutualism, as the fish will tear off and devour fragments of the tentacles and fringe of the
  Medusa, whilst the Medusa will in its turn occasionally capture and devour one of the fish.</p>

  <p>A great many of the Scyphozoa, particularly the larger kinds, have the reputation of being able
  to sting the human skin, and in consequence the name Acalephae<a id="NtA_346"
  href="#Nt_346"><sup>[346]</sup></a> was formerly used to designate the order. Of the British
  species <i>Aurelia aurita</i> is almost harmless, and so is the rarer <i>Rhizostoma pulmo</i>; but
  the nematocysts on the tentacles of <i>Cyanaea</i>, <i>Chrysaora</i>, and <i>Pelagia</i> can
  inflict stings on the more delicate parts of the skin which are very painful for several hours,
  although the pain has been undoubtedly greatly exaggerated in many popular works.</p>

  <p>The soft structure of the Medusae does not favour their preservation in the rocks, but the
  impressions left by several genera, all belonging apparently to the Rhizostomata, have been found
  in Cambrian, Liassic, and Cretaceous deposits.</p>

  <p>There is reason to believe that many Scyphozoa exhibit a considerable range of variation in the
  symmetry of the most important organs of the body. Very little information is, however, at hand
  concerning the variation of any species except <i>Aurelia aurita</i>, which has been the subject
  of several investigations. Browne<a id="NtA_347" href="#Nt_347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> has found
  that in a local race of this species about 20 per cent exhibit variations from the normal in the
  number of the statorhabs, and about 2 per cent in the number of gastric pouches.</p>

  <p>The Scyphozoa are not usually regarded as of any commercial or other value, but in China and
  Japan two species of Rhizostomata (<i>Rhopilema esculenta</i> and <i>R. verrucosa</i>) are used as
  food. <span class="pagenum" id="page313"><span class="smaller">{313}</span></span>The jelly-fish
  is preserved with a mixture of alum and salt or between the steamed leaves of a kind of oak. To
  prepare the preserved food for the table it is soaked in water, cut into small pieces, and
  flavoured. It is also stated that these Medusae are used by fishermen as bait for file-fish and
  sea-bream.<a id="NtA_348" href="#Nt_348"><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In general structure the Scyphozoa occupy an intermediate position between the Hydrozoa and the
  Anthozoa. The very striking resemblance of the body-form to the Medusa of the Hydrozoa, and the
  discovery of a fixed hydriform stage in the life-history of some species, led the older zoologists
  to the conclusion that they should be included in the class Hydrozoa. Recently the finer details
  of development have been invoked to support the view that they are Anthozoa specially adapted for
  a free-swimming existence, but the evidence for this does not appear to us to be conclusive.</p>

  <p>They differ from the Hydrozoa and resemble the Anthozoa in the character that the sexual cells
  are matured in the endoderm, and escape to the exterior by way of the coelenteric cavity, and not
  directly to the exterior by the rupture of the ectoderm as in all Hydrozoa. They differ, on the
  other hand, from the Anthozoa in the absence of a stomodaeum and of mesenteries.</p>

  <p>The view that the Scyphozoa are Anthozoa is based on the belief that the manubrium of the
  former is lined by ectoderm, and is homologous with the stomodaeum of the latter; and that the
  folds of mesogloea between the gastric pouches are homologous with the septa.<a id="NtA_349"
  href="#Nt_349"><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Scyphozoa, notwithstanding their general resemblance to the Medusae of Hydrozoa, can be
  readily distinguished from them by several important characters. The absence of a velum in all of
  them (except the Cubomedusae) is an important and conspicuous character which gave to the class
  the name of Acraspeda. The velum of the Cubomedusae can, however, be distinguished from that of
  the Craspedote Medusae (<i>i.e.</i> the Medusae of the Hydrozoa) by the fact that it contains
  endodermal canals.</p>

  <p>Sense-organs are present in all Scyphozoa except some of the Stauromedusae, and they are in the
  form of statorhabs (tentaculocysts), bearing statoliths at the extremity, and in many species,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page314"><span class="smaller">{314}</span></span>at the base or between
  the base and the extremity, one or more eyes. These organs differ from the statorhabs of the
  Hydrozoa in having, usually, a cavity in the axial endoderm; but as they are undoubtedly specially
  modified marginal tentacles, they are strictly homologous in the two classes. In nearly all the
  Scyphozoa these organs are protected by a hood or fold formed from the free margin of the
  umbrella, and this character, although not of great morphological importance, serves to
  distinguish the common species from the Craspedote Medusae. It was owing to this character that
  Forbes gave the name <span class="sc">Steganophthalmata</span>, or "covered-eyed Medusae," to the
  class.</p>

  <p>Another character of some importance is the presence in the coelenteric cavity of all Scyphozoa
  of clusters or rows of delicate filaments called the "phacellae." These filaments are covered with
  a glandular epithelium, and are usually provided with numerous nematocysts. They have a
  considerable resemblance to the acontia of certain Anthozoa, and are probably mainly digestive in
  function. These three characters, in addition to the very important character of the position and
  method of discharge of the sexual cells already referred to, justify the separation of the
  Scyphozoa from the Medusae of the Hydrozoa as a distinct class of Coelenterata.</p>

  <p>The umbrella of the Scyphozoa varies a good deal in shape. It is usually flattened and
  disc-like (Discophora), but it may be almost globular (<i>Atorella</i>), conical (some species of
  <i>Periphylla</i>), or cubical (Cubomedusae). It is divided into an aboral and a marginal region
  by a circular groove in the Coronata. The margin may be almost entire, marked only by notches
  where the statorhabs occur, or deeply lobed as in the Coronata and many Discophora. Marginal
  tentacles are present in all but the Rhizostomata, and may be few in number, four in
  <i>Charybdea</i>, eight in <i>Ulmaris</i> (Fig. 143), or very numerous in <i>Aurelia</i> and many
  others. The tentacles may be short (<i>Aurelia</i>), or very long as in <i>Chrysaora
  isosceles</i>, in which they extend for a length of twenty yards from the disc.</p>

  <p>The manubrium of the Scyphozoa is usually quadrangular in section, and in those forms in which
  the shape is modified in the adult Medusa the quadrangular shape can be recognised in the earlier
  stages of development. The four angles of the manubrium are of importance in descriptive anatomy,
  as the planes drawn <span class="pagenum" id="page315"><span
  class="smaller">{315}</span></span>through the angles to the centre of the manubrium are called
  "perradial," while those bisecting the perradial planes and passing therefore through the middle
  line of the flat sides of the manubrium are called "interradial."</p>

  <p>The free extremity of the manubrium in many Scyphozoa is provided with four triangular
  perradial lips, which may be simple or may become bifurcated or branched, and have frequently very
  elaborate crenate edges beset with batteries of nematocysts. In <i>Pelagia</i> and
  <i>Chrysaora</i> and other genera these lips hang down from the manubrium as long, ribbon-like,
  folded bands, and according to the size of the specimen may be a foot or more in length, or twice
  the diameter of the disc.</p>

  <p>In the Rhizostomata a peculiar modification of structure takes place in the fusion of the free
  edges of the lips to form a suture perforated by a row of small apertures, so that the lips have
  the appearance of long cylindrical rods or tubes attached to the manubrium, and then frequently
  called the "oral arms." The oral arms may be further provided with tentacles of varying size and
  importance. In many Rhizostomata branched or knobbed processes project from the outer side of the
  upper part of the oral arms. These are called the "epaulettes."</p>

  <p>The lumen of the manubrium leads into a large cavity in the disc, which is usually called the
  gastric cavity, and this is extended into four or more interradial or perradial gastric pouches.
  The number of these pouches is usually four, but in this, as in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page316"><span class="smaller">{316}</span></span>other features of their radial symmetry, the
  jelly-fish frequently exhibit duplication or irregular variation of the radii.<a id="NtA_350"
  href="#Nt_350"><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The gastric pouches may extend to the margin of the disc, where they are united to form a large
  ring sinus, or they may be in communication at the periphery by only a very narrow passage
  (Cubomedusae). In the Discophora the gastric pouches, however, do not extend more than half-way to
  the margin, and they may be connected with the marginal ring-canal by a series of branched
  interradial canals. Between the gastric pouches in these forms branched perradial canals pass from
  the gastric cavity to the marginal ring canal, and the system of canals is completed by unbranched
  "adradial" canals passing between the perradials and interradials from the sides of the gastric
  pouches to the ring-canal (Fig. 143).</p>

  <p>In the Discophora there are four shallow interradial pits or pouches lined by ectoderm on the
  under side of the umbrella-wall. As these pits correspond with the position of the gonads in the
  gastric pouches they are frequently called the "sub-genital pits." In the Stauromedusae and
  Cubomedusae they are continued through the interradial gastric septa to the aboral side of the
  disc, and they are generally known in these cases by the name "interradial funnels." The functions
  and homologies of these ectodermic pits and funnels are still uncertain.</p>

  <p>The Scyphozoa are usually dioecious, but <i>Chrysaora</i> and <i>Linerges</i> are sometimes
  hermaphrodite. The female Medusae can usually be distinguished from the male by the darker or
  brighter colour of the gonads, which are band-shaped, horseshoe-shaped, or circular organs,
  situated on the endoderm of the interradial gastric pouches. They are, when nearly ripe,
  conspicuous and brightly coloured organs, and in nearly all species can be clearly seen through
  the transparent or semi-transparent tissues of the disc. The reproductive cells are discharged
  into the gastric cavity and escape by the mouth. The eggs are probably fertilised in the water,
  and may be retained in special pouches on the lips of the manubrium until the segmentation is
  completed.<a id="NtA_351" href="#Nt_351"><sup>[351]</sup></a> Asexual reproduction does not occur
  in the free-swimming or adult stage of any Scyphozoa. In some cases (probably exceptional) the
  development is direct. In <i>Pelagia</i>, for example, it is known that the fertilised egg gives
  <span class="pagenum" id="page317"><span class="smaller">{317}</span></span>rise to a
  free-swimming Medusa similar in all essential features to the parent.</p>

  <p>In many species, however, the planula larva sinks to the bottom of the sea, develops tentacles,
  and becomes attached by its aboral extremity to a rock or weed, forming a sedentary asexual stage
  of development with a superficial resemblance to a <i>Hydra</i>. This stage is the "Scyphistoma,"
  and notwithstanding its simple external features it is already in all essential anatomical
  characters a Scyphozoon.</p>

  <p>The Scyphistoma may remain as such for some time, during which it reproduces by budding, and in
  some localities it may be found in great numbers on seaweeds and stones.<a id="NtA_352"
  href="#Nt_352"><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the course of time, however, the Scyphistoma exhibits a ring-like constriction of the body
  just below the crown of tentacles, and as this deepens the general features of a Scyphomedusa are
  developed in the free part above the constriction. In time this free part escapes as a small
  free-swimming jelly-fish, called an "Ephyra," while the attached part remains to repeat the
  process. In many species the first constriction is followed by a second immediately below it, then
  a third, a fourth, and so on, until the Scyphistoma is transformed into a long series of narrow
  discs, each one acquiring, as it grows, the Ephyra characters. Such a stage has been compared in
  form to a pile of saucers, and is known as the "Strobila."</p>

  <p>The Ephyra differs from the adult in many respects. The disc is thin and flat, the manubrium
  short, the margin of the umbrella deeply grooved, while the statorhabs are mounted on bifid lobes
  which project outwards from the margin. The stabilisation of the Scyphistoma is a process of
  reproduction by transverse fission, and in some cases this is supplemented by gemmation, the
  Scyphistoma giving rise to a number of buds which become detached from the parent and subsequently
  undergo the process of strobilisation.</p>

  <p>Scyphozoa provided with four perradial statorhabs, each of which bears a statolith and one or
  several eyes. There are four interradial tentacles or groups of tentacles. The stomach is a large
  cavity bearing four tufts of phacellae (Fig. 145, <i>Ph</i>), situated interradially. There are
  four flattened perradial gastric pouches in the wall of the umbrella which communicate with the
  stomach by the gastric ostia (<i>Go</i>). These pouches are separated from one another by four
  interradial septa; and the long leaf-like gonads are attached by one edge to each side of the
  septa. In many respects the Cubomedusae appear to be of simple structure, but the remarkable
  differentiation of the eyes and the occurrence of a velum (p. <a href="#page313">313</a>) suggest

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page319"><span class="smaller">{319}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Charybdea</i> appears to have a very wide geographical distribution. Some of the species are
  usually found in deep water and come to the surface only occasionally, but others (<i>C.
  xaymacana</i>) are only found at the surface of shallow water near the shore. The genus can be
  easily recognised by the four-sided prismatic shape of the bell and the oral flattened expansion
  of the base of the tentacles. The bell varies from 2-6 cm. in length (or height) in <i>C.
  marsupialis</i>, but a giant form, <i>C. grandis</i>,<a id="NtA_354"
  href="#Nt_354"><sup>[354]</sup></a> has recently been discovered off Paumotu Island which is as
  much as 23 cm. in height. The colour is usually yellow or brown, but <i>C. grandis</i> is white
  and <i>C. xaymacana</i> perfectly transparent.</p>

  <p>"<i>Charybdea</i> is a strong and active swimmer, and presents a very beautiful appearance in
  its movements through the water; the quick, vigorous pulsations contrasting sharply with the
  sluggish contractions seen in most Scyphomedusae." It appears to be a voracious feeder. "Some of
  the specimens taken contained in the stomach small fish, so disproportionately large in comparison
  with the stomach that they lay coiled up, head overlapping tail."<a id="NtA_355"
  href="#Nt_355"><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Very little is known of the development, but it is possible that <i>Tamoya punctata</i>, which
  lacks gonads, phacellae, and canals in the velum, may be a young form of a species of
  <i>Charybdea</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Chirodropidae.</b>&mdash;Cubomedusae with four interradial groups of tentacles.</p>

  <p>This family is represented by the genera <i>Chirodropus</i> from the Atlantic and
  <i>Chiropsalmus</i> from the Indian Ocean and the coast of North Carolina.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Tripedaliidae.</b>&mdash;Cubomedusae with four interradial groups of three
  tentacles.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The single genus and species <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i> has only been found in
  shallow water off the coast of Jamaica. Specimens of this species were kept for some time by
  Conant in an aquarium, and produced a number of free-swimming planulae which settled on the glass,
  and quickly developed into small hydras with a mouth and four tentacles. The further development
  of this sedentary stage is unfortunately not known.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page320"><span class="smaller">{320}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Stauromedusae.</b></p>

  <p>This order contains several genera provided with an aboral stalk which usually terminates in a
  sucker, by means of which the animal is temporarily fixed to some foreign object. There can be
  little doubt that this sedentary habit is recently acquired, and the wide range of the
  characteristic features of the order may be accounted for as a series of adaptations to the change
  from a free-swimming to a sedentary habit.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to give in a few words the characters of the order, but the Stauromedusae
  differ from other Scyphozoa in the absence or profound modification in structure and function of
  the statorhabs. They are absent in <i>Lucernaria</i> and the Depastridae, and very variable in
  number in <i>Haliclystus</i>.</p>

  <p>The statorhab of <i>Haliclystus</i> terminates in a spherical knob, which is succeeded by a
  large annular pad or collar bearing a number of glandular cells which secrete a sticky fluid. At
  the base of the organ there is a rudimentary ocellus. The number is very variable, and sometimes
  they are abnormal in character, being "crowned with tentacles." There can be little doubt that the
  principal function of these organs is not sensory but adhesive, and hence they have received the
  names "colletocystophores" and "marginal anchors," but they are undoubtedly homologous with the
  statorhabs of other Scyphozoa.</p>

  <p>The tentacles are short and numerous, and are frequently mounted in groups on the summit of
  digitate outgrowths from the margin of the umbrella. They are capitate, except in <i>Tessera</i>,
  the terminal swelling containing a battery of nematocysts.</p>

  <p>Very little is known concerning the life-history and development of the Stauromedusae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Lucernariidae.</b>&mdash;Marginal lobes digitate, bearing the capitate tentacles in
  groups. <i>Haliclystus auricula</i> is a common form on the shores of the Channel Islands, at
  Plymouth, and other localities on the British coast. It may be recognised by the prominent
  statorhabs situated in the bays between the digitate lobes of the margin of the umbrella. Each of
  the marginal lobes bears from 15 to 20 capitate tentacles. It is from 2 to 3 cm. in length. The
  genus occurs in shallow water <span class="pagenum" id="page321"><span
  class="smaller">{321}</span></span>off the coasts of Europe and North America, extending south
  into the Antarctic region.</p>

  <p><i>Lucernaria</i> differs from <i>Haliclystus</i> in the absence of statorhabs. It has the same
  habit as <i>Haliclystus</i>, and is often found associated with it. <i>L. campanulata</i> is
  British.</p>

  <p><i>Halicyathus</i> is similar in external features to <i>Haliclystus</i>, but differs from it
  in certain important characters of the coelenteric cavities. It is found off the coasts of Norway,
  Greenland, and the Atlantic side of North America.</p>

  <p>In <i>Capria</i>, from the Mediterranean, the tentacles are replaced by a denticulated membrane
  bearing nematocysts.</p>

  <p>The rare genus <i>Tessera</i>, from the Antarctic Ocean, differs from all the other
  Stauromedusae in having no stalk and in having only a few relatively long non-capitate tentacles.
  If <i>Tessera</i> is really an adult form it should be placed in a separate family, but,
  notwithstanding the presence of gonads, it may prove to be but a free-swimming stage in the
  history of a normally stalked genus.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Depastridae.</b>&mdash;The margin of the umbrella is provided with eight shallow
  lobes bearing one or more rows of tentacles. Statorhabs absent.</p>

  <p><i>Depastrum cyathiforme</i> occurs in shallow water at Plymouth, Port Erin, and in other
  localities on the coasts of Britain and Norway. The tentacles are arranged in several rows on the
  margin of the umbrella. In <i>Depastrella</i> from the Canaries there is only one row of marginal
  tentacles.</p>

  <p>The external surface of the umbrella is divided into two regions, an aboral region and a
  marginal region, by a well-marked circular groove (the coronal groove). The aboral region is
  usually smooth and undivided, but it is an elongated dome, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page322"><span class="smaller">{322}</span></span>thimble- or cone-shaped, in marked contrast
  to the flattened umbrella of the Discophora. The margin is divided into a number of triangular or
  rounded lobes, and these are continued as far as the coronal groove as distinct areas delimited by
  shallow grooves on the surface of the umbrella. The tentacles arise from the grooves between the
  marginal areas, and are provided with expanded bases called the pedalia. The manubrium may be
  short or moderately long, but it is never provided with long lips.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Periphyllidae.</b><a id="NtA_358" href="#Nt_358"><sup>[358]</sup></a>&mdash;Coronata
  with four or six statorhabs.</p>

  <p>In <i>Pericolpa</i> (Kerguelen) there are only four tentacles and four statorhabs. In
  <i>Periphylla</i>, a remarkable deep-sea genus from 700 to 2000 fathoms in all seas, but
  occasionally found at the surface, there are twelve tentacles and four statorhabs. The specimens
  from deep water have a characteristic dark red-brown or violet-brown colour. They are usually
  small Medusae, but the umbrella of <i>P. regina</i> is over 21 cm. in diameter. <i>Atorella</i>
  has six tentacles and six statorhabs.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Ephyropsidae.</b>&mdash;Coronata with eight or more than eight statorhabs.</p>

  <p><i>Nausithoe punctata</i> is a small, transparent jelly-fish, not exceeding 10 mm. in diameter,

  <i>N. rubra</i>, a species of a reddish colour found at a considerable depth in the South Atlantic
  and Indian Oceans, is probably an abysmal form. <i>Palephyra</i> differs from <i>Nausithoe</i> in
  having elongated instead of rounded gonads. <i>Linantha</i> and <i>Linuche</i> differ from the
  others in having subdivided marginal lobes.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 3. Atollidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Atolla</i> is a deep-sea jelly-fish of very wide
  geographical distribution. It is characterised by the multiplication of the marginal appendages,
  but the number is very irregular. There may be double or quadruple the usual number of marginal
  lobes, or an indefinite number. There may be sixteen to thirty-two statorhabs, and the number of
  tentacles is quite irregular. Some of the species attain a considerable size, the diameter of the
  umbrella of <i>A. gigantea</i> being 150 mm., of <i>A. valdiviae</i> sometimes 130 mm., and of
  <i>A. bairdi</i> 110 mm.</p>

  <p>This order contains not only by far the greater number of the species of Scyphozoa, but those
  of the largest size, and all those that are familiar to the seaside visitor and the mariner under
  the general term jelly-fish.</p>

  <p class="sp3">They may be distinguished from the other Scyphozoa by several well-marked
  characters. The umbrella is flattened and disc-shaped or slightly domed, but not divided by a
  coronary groove. The perradial angles of the mouth are prolonged into long lips, which may remain
  free (Semaeostomata) or fuse to form an elaborate proboscis (Rhizostomata).</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order I. Semaeostomata.</b></p>

  <p>In this sub-order the mouth is a large aperture leading into the cavity of the manubrium, and

  provided with long tentacles.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Pelagiidae.</b>&mdash;Semaeostomata with wide gastric pouches, which are not united
  by a marginal ring sinus. <i>Pelagia</i>, which forms the type of this family, has eight long
  marginal tentacles. It develops directly from the egg, the fixed Scyphistoma stage being
  eliminated.<a id="NtA_359" href="#Nt_359"><sup>[359]</sup></a> It is probably in consequence of
  this peculiarity of its development and independence of a shore for fixation that <i>Pelagia</i>
  has become a common and widespread inhabitant of the high seas. In the Atlantic and Indian Oceans
  <i>P. phosphora</i> occurs in swarms or in long narrow lines many miles in length. It is
  remarkable for its power of emitting phosphorescent light. In the Atlantic it extends from 50&deg; N.
  to 40&deg; S., but is rare or absent from the colder regions. <i>P. perla</i> is found occasionally on
  the west coast of Ireland. <i>Chrysaora</i> differs from <i>Pelagia</i> in the larger number of
  tentacles. There are, in all, 24 tentacles and 8 statorhabs, separated by 32 lobes of the margin
  of the umbrella. <i>C. isosceles</i> is occasionally found off the British coast. It passes
  through a typical Scyphistoma stage in development. <i>Dactylometra</i>, a very <span

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Ulmaridae.</b>&mdash;The gastric pouches are relatively small, and communicate with
  a marginal ring-canal by branching perradial and interradial canals and unbranched adradial
  canals.</p>

  <p>In <i>Ulmaris prototypus</i> (Fig. 143, p. <a href="#page315">315</a>) there are only eight
  long adradial tentacles, and the lips of the manubrium are relatively short. It is found in the

  <p class="sp3"><i>Aurelia</i> is a well-known and cosmopolitan genus, which may be recognised by
  the eight shallow lobes of the umbrella-margin beset with a fringe of numerous small
  tentacles.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order II. Rhizostomata.</b></p>

  <p>In this sub-order the lips are very much exaggerated in size, and are fused together by their
  margin in such a manner that the mouth of the animal is reduced to a number of small apertures
  situated along the lines of suture. Tentacles are absent on the margin of the umbrella. This
  sub-order contains some of the largest known jelly-fishes, and exhibits a considerable range of
  structure. The families are arranged by Maas<a id="NtA_360" href="#Nt_360"><sup>[360]</sup></a> in
  three groups.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Group I. <span class="sc">Arcadomyaria.</span>&mdash;Musculature of the disc arranged in
  feather-like arcades. Oral arms pinnate.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Cassiopeidae.</b>&mdash;There are no epaulettes on the arms. Labial tentacles present.
  <i>Cassiopea</i> is common in the Indo-Pacific seas, and extends into the Red Sea. It includes a
  great many species varying in size from 4 to about 12 cm. in diameter.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Group II. <span class="sc">Radiomyaria.</span>&mdash;Musculature arranged in radial tracts.
  Oral arms bifid.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Cepheidae.</b>&mdash;The genera included in this family differ <span class="pagenum"
  id="page325"><span class="smaller">{325}</span></span>from the Cassiopeidae in the characters of
  the group. <i>Cephea</i> is found in the Indo-Pacific Oceans and Red Sea. <i>Cotylorhiza</i> is
  common in the Mediterranean Sea and extends into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Group III. <span class="sc">Cyclomyaria.</span>&mdash;The group contains the majority of the
  Rhizostomata. Musculature arranged in circular bands round the disc. Oral arms primarily trifid,
  but becoming in some cases very complicated. The principal families are<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><b>Fam. Rhizostomatidae.</b>&mdash;With well-marked epaulettes, and sixteen radial canals
  passing to the margin of the umbrella.</p>

  <p><i>Rhizostoma pulmo</i> (= <i>Pilema octopus</i>), a widely distributed species, is often found
  floating at the surface off the western coasts of Scotland and Ireland, and sometimes drifts up
  the English Channel into the German Ocean in the autumn. The umbrella is about two feet in
  diameter, and the combined length of the umbrella and arms is four feet. The colour varies
  considerably, but that of a specimen obtained off Valencia in 1895 was described as follows: "The
  colour of the umbrella was pale green, with a deep reddish margin. Arms bright blue."<a
  id="NtA_361" href="#Nt_361"><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The family includes <i>Stomolophus</i>, of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of America, in which
  the oral arms are united at the base, and <i>Rhopilema</i>, the edible Medusa of Japan and
  China.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Lychnorhizidae.</b>&mdash;Here there are only eight radial canals reaching as far as
  the margin of the umbrella, and eight terminating in the ring-canal. There are no epaulettes, and
  the oral tentacles are often very long. The family includes <i>Lychnorhiza</i> from the coast of
  Brazil, <i>Crambione</i> from the Malay Archipelago, and <i>Crambessa</i> from the Atlantic shores
  of France and Spain and from Brazil and Australia. The last-named genus has been found in brackish
  water at the mouth of the Loire.</p>

  <p class="sp5">In the families <b>Leptobrachiidae</b> and <b>Catostylidae</b> there are eight
  radial canals reaching the margin of the umbrella, and between them a network of canals with many
  openings into the ring-canal. In a few of the Leptobrachiidae the intermediate canal-network has
  only eight openings into the ring-canal, as in the Lychnorhizidae.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">COELENTERATA
  (<i>CONTINUED</i>): ANTHOZOA = ACTINOZOA&mdash;GENERAL CHARACTERS&mdash;ALCYONARIA</span></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS III. ANTHOZOA = ACTINOZOA</p>

  <p>Among the familiar objects included in this class are the Sea-anemones, the Stony Corals
  (Madrepores), the Flexible Corals, the Precious Coral, and the Sea-pens. With the exception of a
  few species of Sea-anemone, Anthozoa are not commonly found on British sea-shores; but in those
  parts of the tropical world where coral reefs occur, the shore at low tide is carpeted with
  various forms of this class, and the sands and beaches are almost entirely composed of their
  broken-down skeletons.</p>

  <p>The majority of the Anthozoa are colonial in habit, a large number of individuals, or zooids as
  they are called, being organically connected together by a network of nutritive canals, and
  forming a communal gelatinous or stony matrix for their protection and support. Whilst the
  individuals are usually small or minute, the colonial masses they form are frequently large.
  Single colonies of the stony corals form blocks of stone which are sometimes five feet in
  diameter, and reach a height of two or three feet from the ground. From the tree or shrub-like
  form assumed by many of the colonies they were formerly included in a class Zoophyta or
  animal-plants.</p>

  <p>But whether the individual polyps are large or small, whether they form colonies in the adult
  condition or remain independent, they exhibit certain characters in common which distinguish them
  not only from the other Coelenterata, but from all other animals. When an individual zooid is
  examined in the living and fully expanded condition, it is seen to possess a cylindrical <span
  class="pagenum" id="page327"><span class="smaller">{327}</span></span>body, attached at one end
  (the aboral end) to the common colonial matrix or to some foreign object. At the opposite or free
  extremity it is provided with a mouth surrounded by a crown of tentacles. In these respects,
  however, they resemble in a general way some of the Hydrozoa. It is only when the internal anatomy
  is examined that we find the characters which are absolutely diagnostic of the group.</p>

  <p>In the Hydrozoa the mouth leads directly into the coelenteric cavity; in the Anthozoa, however,
  the mouth leads into a short tube or throat, called the "stomodaeum," which opens into the
  coelenteric cavity. Moreover, this tube is connected with the body-wall, and is supported by a
  series of fleshy vertical bands called the mesenteries (Fig. 146). The mesenteries not only
  support the stomodaeum, but extend some distance below it. Where the mesenteries are free from the
  stomodaeum their edges are thickened to form the important digestive organs known as the
  mesenteric filaments (<i>mf</i>). It is in the possession of a stomodaeum, mesenteries, and
  mesenteric filaments that the Anthozoa differ from all the other Coelenterata. There is one
  character that the Anthozoa share with the Scyphozoa, and that is, that the gonads or sexual cells
  (G) are derived from the endoderm. They are discharged first into the coelenteric cavity, and then
  by way of the mouth to the exterior. In the Anthozoa the gonads are situated on the
  mesenteries.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Nearly all the Anthozoa are sedentary in habit. They begin life as ciliated free-swimming
  larvae, and then, in a few hours or days, they become attached to some rock or shell at the bottom
  and immediately (if colonial) start the process of budding, which gives rise to the colonies of
  the adult stage. Many of the Sea-anemones, however, move considerable distances by gliding <span
  class="pagenum" id="page328"><span class="smaller">{328}</span></span>over the rocks or seaweeds,
  others habitually burrow in the sand (<i>Edwardsia</i>, <i>Cerianthus</i>), and one family (the
  Minyadidae) are supported by a gas bladder, and float at the surface of the sea. The Sea-pens,
  too, although usually partly buried in the sand or mud, are capable of shifting their position by
  alternate distension and contraction of the stalk.<a id="NtA_362"
  href="#Nt_362"><sup>[362]</sup></a> The Anthozoa are exclusively marine. With the exception of a
  few Sea-anemones that are found in brackish or almost fresh water in river estuaries, they only
  occur in salt sea water. The presence of a considerable admixture of fresh water, such as we find
  at the mouths of rivers, seems to interfere very materially with the development and growth of all
  the reef-forming Corals, as will be noticed again in the chapter on coral reefs. A few genera
  descend into the greatest depths of the ocean, but the home of the Anthozoa is pre-eminently the
  shallow seas, and they are usually found in great abundance in depths of 0-40 fathoms from the
  shores of the Arctic and Antarctic lands to the equatorial belt.</p>

  <p>The only Anthozoa of any commercial importance are the Precious Corals belonging to the
  Alcyonarian family Coralliidae. The hard pink axis of these corals has been used extensively from
  remote times in the manufacture of jewellery and ornaments. Until quite recently the only
  considerable and systematic fishery for the Precious Corals was carried on in the Mediterranean
  Sea, and this practically supplied the markets of the world. In more recent times, however, an
  important industry in corals has been developed in Japan. In 1901 the value of the coral obtained
  on the coasts of Japan was over &pound;50,000, the greater part of which was exported to Italy, a
  smaller part to China, and a fraction only retained for home consumption. The history of the coral
  fishery in Japan is of considerable interest. Coral was occasionally taken off the coast of
  Tsukinada in early times. But in the time of the Daimyos the collection and sale of coral was
  prohibited, for fear, it is said, that the Daimyo of Tosa might be compelled to present such
  precious treasure to the Shogun. After the Meiji reform, however (1868), the industry revived, new
  grounds were discovered, improved methods employed, and a large export trade developed.</p>

  <p>There is evidence, however, in the art of Japan, of another <span class="pagenum"
  id="page329"><span class="smaller">{329}</span></span>coral fishery in ancient times, of which the
  history is lost. Coral was imported into Japan at least two hundred years ago, and used largely in
  the manufacture of those exquisite pieces of handicraft for which that country is so justly
  famous. On many of the carved "Netsukes" and other ornaments, however, the coral branches are
  represented as the booty of dark-skinned, curly-headed fishermen, "kurombo," and never of Japanese
  fishermen. The coral used in this art-work can hardly be distinguished from Mediterranean coral,
  and there are some grounds for believing that Japan imported coral from the far West in very early
  times. But this does not account for the "kurombo." The only coast-dwelling people of the type
  that is so clearly carved on these ornaments within the area of the Pacific Ocean at the present
  time are the Melanesians and Papuans, and the suggestion occurs that a coral fishery existed at
  one time in the Southern Pacific, which has since been lost.<a id="NtA_363"

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The class <span class="sc">Anthozoa</span> is divided into two sub-classes:&mdash;I. <span
  class="sc">Alcyonaria</span>; II. <span class="sc">Zoantharia</span>.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the Alcyonaria the fully developed zooids have always eight tentacles and eight
  mesenteries. In the Zoantharia the number of tentacles and the number of mesenteries in the fully
  developed zooids may be six, twelve, twenty-four, or an indefinite number, but individuals with
  eight mesenteries and only eight tentacles are not known to occur.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Class I. Alcyonaria.</b></p>

  <p>This sub-class includes a large number of genera living in shallow sea-water and a few genera
  that extend down into deep water. With a few doubtful exceptions (Protoalcyonacea) they all form
  colonies composed of a large number of zooids. These zooids may be connected together by basal
  plates or a network of basal strands (stolons), or by stolons with additional connecting bars
  (<b>Clavularia viridis</b>, <b>Syringopora</b>) or by plates (<b>Tubipora</b>). In the majority of
  the genera the individual zooids are for the greater part of their length, from the base upwards,
  united together to form a continuous spongy, colonial mass, which determines the shape of the
  colony as a whole.</p>

  <p>In this last-named group of genera there may be <span class="pagenum" id="page330"><span
  class="smaller">{330}</span></span>distinguished the free distal portions of the zooids bearing
  the mouths and tentacles (the "anthocodiae") from the common colonial mass perforated by the
  coelenteric cavities of the individual zooids. The coelenteric cavities are separated by a
  considerable amount of a substance called the "mesogloea," usually gelatinous in consistency but
  chemically more closely related to mucin than to gelatin, which is traversed by endodermal canals,
  rods of endoderm cells and a number of free amoeboid cells. In this substance, moreover, there are
  found in nearly all cases numerous spicules of carbonate of lime formed by the "scleroblasts"
  (spicule-forming cells) which have wandered from the superficial ectoderm of the common colonial
  mass. This common colonial mesogloea with its spicules, endoderm cells, and superficial covering
  of ectoderm is called the "coenenchym." The form assumed by the colonies is very varied. In some
  species of <i>Clavularia</i> they form encrusting plates following the irregularity of the rock or
  stones on which they grow, in <i>Alcyonium</i> they construct lobed masses of irregular form, in
  <i>Sarcophytum</i> they are usually shaped like a mushroom, in <i>Juncella</i> they are long
  whip-like rods, in most of the Gorgonacea they are branched in all directions like shrubs or in
  one plane to form fan-shaped growths, and in many of the Pennatulacea they assume that graceful
  feather form which gives the order its name.</p>

  <p>The consistency and texture of the colonies also varies considerably. In some cases where the
  spicules are few or very small, the substance of the colony is soft to the touch, and frequently
  slimy at the surface, in other cases the great number of the spicules makes the colony hard but
  brittle, whilst in a few genera (<i>Sclerophytum</i>, <i>Heliopora</i>) the colony is so hard that
  it can only be broken by the hand with difficulty. In some genera (<i>Spongodes</i> and the
  Muriceidae) projecting spicules cause the surface to be rough or thorny, and in the Primnoidae the
  zooids and the surface of the general coenenchym are protected by a series of overlapping scales
  or plates.</p>

  <p>In all the Alcyonaria the nematocysts are very minute, and although they can undoubtedly
  paralyse minute organisms they are unable to penetrate the human skin. None of the Alcyonaria have
  been described as stinging-corals except the Pennatulid <i>Virgularia rumphii</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Zooids.</b>&mdash;The fully formed zooids of the Alcyonaria exhibit <span class="pagenum"
  id="page331"><span class="smaller">{331}</span></span>a remarkable uniformity of structure. They
  have eight intermesenteric tentacles containing a cavity continuous with the coelenteron. Each of
  these tentacles bears at least two rows of simple pinnules, and they are therefore said to be
  "pinnate" tentacles. In some species of <i>Xenia</i> the tentacles may have three or four rows of
  pinnules, which give them a much more feathery appearance than is usually the case. In the great
  majority of species a single row of from eight to fourteen pinnules is found disposed laterally on
  each side of the tentacle. The mouth is usually small and slit-like with a slight rounded gape at
  the ventral extremity. The stomodaeum is usually very short, but in <i>Xenia</i> and in the
  autozooids of some Pennatulids it is relatively much longer. It is not known how far the
  stomodaeum is of importance in the digestion of the food. In <i>Xenia</i><a id="NtA_364"
  href="#Nt_364"><sup>[364]</sup></a> it has probably some importance, as shown by its unusual
  length and the numerous large goblet cells (mucus cells) which it exhibits, associated with the
  fact that the mesenteric filaments are relatively very small. In <i>Alcyonium</i> and other
  Alcyonaria gland cells also occur in the stomodaeum, and it is probable that they secrete a fluid
  capable of digesting to some extent the food as it passes through. The most important part of the
  digestion, however, is performed by the six "ventral" mesenteric filaments.</p>

  <p>Attention has already been drawn to the fact (p. <a href="#page330">330</a>) that two regions
  of the zooids of the colonial Alcyonaria can be recognised. At the oral end there is a region,
  which in the fully expanded condition consists of a crown of eight tentacles surrounding the
  mouth, and a body-wall free from its immediate neighbours. This region is called the "anthocodia."
  The anthocodia is continuous with a region which forms a part of the common colonial mass. Some
  genera seem to have very little power of contracting the tentacles or of withdrawing the
  anthocodiae. The zooids of <i>Stereosoma</i>, of <i>Xenia</i>, of <i>Umbellula</i>, and of a few
  other genera may be described as non-retractile. In many cases, however, the tentacles can be
  considerably contracted, bent over the mouth, and withdrawn into the shelter of the subjacent
  body-wall. In such a condition the surface of the colony exhibits a number of tubular, conical, or
  convex protuberances, called "verrucae," and the colony is said to be partially retractile. In
  many genera, however, the whole of the <span class="pagenum" id="page332"><span
  class="smaller">{332}</span></span>anthocodiae can be withdrawn below the general surface of the
  coenenchym, so that the position of the zooids in the colony is indicated only by star-like holes,
  or simple key-hole slits in the superficial coenenchym. Such colonies are said to be completely
  retractile (Fig. 147).</p>

  <p>It is often very difficult to determine whether a particular species is or is not completely
  retractile, unless observations can be made upon the living colony; and there are many instances
  of confusion in the work of systematists due to a species being described as partially retractile
  in one instance, and completely retractile in another. The complete retraction of the anthocodiae
  may be effected very slowly, and after continuous irritation only. If the colony is killed too
  quickly, the anthocodiae remain in a state of partial retraction. An example of this may be found
  in the common British <i>Alcyonium digitatum</i>. Specimens of this species which are put into a
  bucket of sea water and allowed to roll about with the movements of a small boat in a rough sea,
  undergo complete retraction; but if the same specimens be allowed to expand in the aquarium, and
  then plunged into spirit, or allowed to dry in the sun, they will die in a condition of partial
  retraction.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The phenomenon of dimorphism occurs in some Alcyonaria. A certain number of the zooids of a
  colony are arrested in their development, and are known as the "siphonozooids." They may be
  distinguished from the fully formed zooids, which, in these <span class="pagenum"
  id="page333"><span class="smaller">{333}</span></span>cases, are called the "autozooids," by the
  absence of tentacles, by the absence of the six ventral and lateral mesenteric filaments, and by
  the incomplete development of the muscles on the mesenteries, and of the mesenteries themselves.
  They are, moreover, frequently distinguished by the greater development and extent of the ciliated
  groove or siphonoglyph on the ventral side of the stomodaeum.</p>

  <p>It is often difficult to distinguish between true siphonozooids and young autozooids, and
  consequently dimorphism has been attributed to some genera in which it almost certainly does not
  occur. Simple dimorphism undoubtedly occurs in the genera <i>Heteroxenia</i>, <i>Sarcophytum</i>,
  <i>Anthomastus</i>, <i>Lobophytum</i>, <i>Acrophytum</i>, and <i>Paragorgia</i>. It has also been
  said to occur in <i>Corallium</i> (Moseley and Kishinouye), <i>Melitodes</i> (Ridley), and some
  species of Dasygorgiidae.</p>

  <p>The Pennatulacea are trimorphic. The main shaft of these colonies is the much modified first
  formed or axial zooid, adapted for the support of all the other zooids. It usually exhibits no
  mouth, no tentacles, and only four of the original eight mesenteries. It has no mesenteric
  filaments and no stomodaeum, and bears no sexual cells. The other zooids of the colony are similar
  in structure to the autozooids and siphonozooids of the dimorphic Alcyonaria.</p>

  <p>There are eight <b>mesenteric filaments</b> in all Alcyonarian zooids. They have the appearance
  of thickenings of the free edges of the mesenteries. Two of them, called the "dorsal" mesenteric
  filaments, are straight when the anthocodia is expanded, and extend from the edge of the
  stomodaeum for a long distance down into the coelenteron of the zooid; the other six, called the
  "ventral" mesenteric filaments (<i>i.e.</i> the ventral and ventro-lateral and dorso-lateral), are
  usually short and are almost invariably slightly convoluted. The dorsal filaments are built up of
  columnar cells provided with long cilia, and have usually no gland cells, the others may show a
  few cilia but are principally composed of non-ciliated gland cells. When the bolus of food has
  passed through the stomodaeum it is seized by these ventral filaments and rapidly disintegrated by
  the secretion of its cells. The function of the dorsal mesenteric filaments is mainly respiratory.
  During life their cilia produce a current which flows towards the stomodaeum. On the ventral side
  of the <span class="pagenum" id="page334"><span class="smaller">{334}</span></span>stomodaeum
  itself there is a groove called the "siphonoglyph" composed of a specialised epithelium bearing
  long powerful cilia. But the current produced by the siphonoglyph flows from the mouth downwards
  into the coelenteric cavity and is thus in the opposite direction to that produced by the dorsal
  mesenteric filaments. It is very probable that these two currents on the opposite sides of the
  zooids maintain the circulation of water in the deep-seated parts of the colony which is necessary
  for the respiration of the tissues.</p>

  <p>On each of the eight mesenteries there is a longitudinal ridge due to the presence of a band of
  retractor muscles. The position of these muscles on the ventral surfaces of the mesenteries only
  is one of the characteristic features of the sub-class (Fig. 148, and p. <a
  href="#page329">329</a>). They vary considerably in thickness and extent according to the power of
  retractility possessed by the zooids, but they never vary in their position on the
  mesenteries.</p>

  <p>The <b>skeleton</b> of Alcyonaria may consist of spicules of calcium carbonate, of a horny
  substance frequently impregnated with calcium carbonate and associated with spicules of the same
  substance, or in <i>Heliopora</i> alone, among recent forms, of a continuous crystalline corallum
  of calcium carbonate.</p>

  <p>The spicules constitute one of the most characteristic features of the Alcyonaria. They are not
  found in <i>Cornularia</i>, <i>Stereosoma</i>, in a recently discovered genus of Gorgoniidae
  (<i>Malacogorgia</i>), in certain Pennatulacea and in <i>Heliopora</i>; and it is probable that
  they may be absent in some local varieties of certain species of <i>Clavularia</i>.</p>

  <p>The spicules of Alcyonaria consist of an organic matrix <span class="pagenum"
  id="page335"><span class="smaller">{335}</span></span>supporting a quantity of crystalline calcium
  carbonate. In some cases (<i>Xenia</i>) the amount of inorganic salt is so small that the spicule
  retains its shape after prolonged immersion in an acid; but generally speaking the relative amount
  of calcium carbonate is so great that it is only by the careful decalcification of the spicules in
  weak acetic acid that the delicate fibrous organic matrix can be demonstrated.</p>

  <p>The spicules vary in size from minute granules to long spindles 9 mm. in length
  (<i>Spongodes</i>, sp.). They exhibit so many varieties of shape that an attempt must be made to
  place them in groups. The most prevalent type perhaps is that called the spindle. This is a
  rod-shaped spicule with more or less pointed extremities. They are usually ornamented with short
  simple or compound wart-like tubercles (Fig. 149, <span class="smaller">5</span>). Spicules
  belonging to this type are found in all the principal subdivisions of the group except the
  Pennatulacea.</p>

  <p>In the Pennatulacea a very characteristic form of spicule is a long rod or needle marked with
  two or three slightly twisted ridges, frequently a little knobbed or swollen at the extremities.
  In the same group, in <i>Xenia</i> and <i>Heteroxenia</i> among the Alcyonacea, and in the family
  Chrysogorgiidae the spicules are in the form of minute discs or spheres, and in some genera the
  discs may be united in couples (twins) or in threes (triplets) by short connecting bars (Fig. 149,
  <span class="smaller">10</span>). More irregular calcareous corpuscles of minute size are found in
  some genera of Pennatulacea.</p>

  <p>Other characteristic spicules are the warted clubs of <i>Juncella</i>, the torch-like spicules
  of <i>Eunicella</i> (Fig. 149, <span class="smaller">3</span>), the clubs with irregular leaf-like
  expansions at one extremity ("Blattkeulen") of <i>Eunicea</i>, and the flat but very irregular
  scales of the Primnoidae. There are also many genera exhibiting spicules of quite irregular form
  (Fig. 149, <span class="smaller">8</span>).</p>

  <p>In the greater number of cases the spicules lie loosely in the mesogloea and readily separate
  when the soft tissues of the colony decay or are dissolved in a solution of potash. In a few
  noteworthy examples the spicules become in their growth tightly wedged together to form a compact
  skeleton, which cannot subsequently be disintegrated into its constituent elements. In the
  Precious corals (Coralliidae) the spicules of the axial region fuse together to form a solid mass
  of lime almost as hard and compact as the substance of a pearl.</p>

  <p>In <i>Paragorgia</i> and some other closely related genera the spicules of the axis of the
  colony also become tightly wedged together, but the core thus formed is far more porous and
  brittle than it is in the Coralliidae. In <i>Tubipora</i> (the organ-pipe coral) and in <i>Telesto
  rubra</i> the spicules of the body-walls of the zooids fuse to form perforated calcareous tubes.
  In some species of <i>Sclerophytum</i> the large spicules of the coenenchym become so closely
  packed that they form dense stony masses, almost as hard as a Perforate Madreporarian coral. The
  horny substance, allied chemically to keratin, plays an <span class="pagenum" id="page337"><span
  class="smaller">{337}</span></span>important part in the building up of skeletal structures in
  many Alcyonaria. In <i>Clavularia viridis</i> and in <i>Stereosoma</i> a change in the chemical
  character of the mesogloea of the body-walls of the polyps leads to the formation of a horny tube,
  which in the former case is built up of interlacing fibres, and in the latter is formed as a
  homogeneous sheath. In many of the Alcyonacea which have a compact axial skeleton the spicules are
  cemented together by a horny matrix.</p>

  <p>In the Gorgonellidae and some others the hard axis is formed of a horny substance impregnated
  with a crystalline form of calcium carbonate; but in the Gorgoniidae, many of the Pennatulacea and
  some other genera very little or no carbonate of lime is found in the horny axis.</p>

  <p>The skeleton of the genus <i>Heliopora</i> differs from that of all the other Alcyonaria in its
  development, structure, and form. In the words of Dr. G. C. Bourne,<a id="NtA_365"
  href="#Nt_365"><sup>[365]</sup></a> "the calcareous skeleton of <i>Heliopora</i> is not formed
  from spicules developed within cells but is a crystalline structure formed by crystallisation of
  carbonate of lime, probably in the form of aragonite, in an organic matrix produced by the
  disintegration of cells which I have described as calicoblasts." It is further characterised by
  its blue colour. A peculiar form of the axial skeleton (Fig. 155), consisting of alternate nodes
  mainly composed of keratin, and internodes mainly composed of calcium carbonate, is seen in the
  families Isidae and Melitodidae. In the Melitodidae the nodes contain a considerable number of
  loose spicules, and the internodes are mainly composed of spicules in close contact but firmly
  cemented together by a sparse horny matrix. In the Isidae the scanty calcareous substance of the
  nodes, and the bulk of the substance of the internodes, is formed of amorphous crystalline
  limestone.</p>

  <p>The Alcyonaria exhibit a great variety of <b>colour</b>. Very little is known at present of the
  chemistry of the various pigments found in the group, but they may conveniently be arranged in two
  sections, the soluble pigments and the insoluble pigments. To the former section belong various
  green and brown pigments found in the anthocodiae and superficial coenenchym of many genera. These
  are related to chlorophyll, and may be very largely the product, not of the Alcyonarians
  themselves, but of the <span class="pagenum" id="page338"><span
  class="smaller">{338}</span></span>symbiotic "Algae" (cf. p. <a href="#page261">261</a>) they
  carry. A diffuse salmon-pink colour soluble in spirit occurs in the living <i>Primnoa
  lepadifera</i> of the Norwegian fjords, and a similar but paler pink colour occurs in some
  varieties of the common <i>Alcyonium digitatum</i>. Gilchrist<a id="NtA_366"
  href="#Nt_366"><sup>[366]</sup></a> states that when he was preserving specimens of <i>Alcyonium
  purpureum</i> from Cape waters a considerable quantity of a soluble purple pigment escaped.</p>

  <p>But the predominant colour of Alcyonarians is usually due to the insoluble pigments of the
  calcareous spicules. These may be of varying shades of purple, red, orange, and yellow. The
  colours may be constant for a species or genus, or they may vary in different specimens of one
  species, or even in different parts of a single colony. Thus the skeletons of <i>Tubipora
  musica</i> from all parts of the world have a red colour, the species of the genus
  <i>Anthomastus</i> have always red spicules. On the other hand, we find in <i>Melitodes
  dichotoma</i> red and yellow varieties in the same locality, and in <i>M. chamaeleon</i> some of
  the branches of a colony are red and others yellow. In <i>Chironephthya variabilis</i> the colour
  of the spicules in any one specimen varies considerably, but in a collection of several specimens
  from a single locality a kaleidoscopic play of colours may be seen, no two specimens being exactly
  the same in the arrangement of their colour pattern. The influences that determine the colour of
  the spicules is at present quite unknown, and in view of the great variability that occurs in this
  respect, colour must be regarded as a most uncertain guide for the determination of species. The
  blue colour of the genus <i>Heliopora</i> is due to a peculiar pigment which shows characteristic
  bands in the spectrum.<a id="NtA_367" href="#Nt_367"><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Phosphorescence.</b>&mdash;A great many Alcyonaria are known to be phosphorescent. Moseley
  says that "All the Alcyonarians dredged by the 'Challenger' in deep water were found to be
  brilliantly phosphorescent when brought to the surface." The phosphorescence of the common British
  <i>Pennatula phosphorea</i> has attracted more attention than that of any other species, and has
  been well described by Panceri, Forbes, and others. Forbes<a id="NtA_368"
  href="#Nt_368"><sup>[368]</sup></a> says, "The pen is phosphorescent only when irritated by touch;
  the phosphorescence appears at the place touched, and <span class="pagenum" id="page339"><span
  class="smaller">{339}</span></span>proceeds thence in an undulating wave to the extremity of the
  rachis, but never in the opposite direction; it is only the parts at and above the point of
  stimulation that show phosphorescence, the light is emitted for a longer time from the point of
  stimulation than from the other luminous parts; detached portions may show phosphorescence. When
  plunged in fresh water, the <i>Pennatula</i> scatters sparks about in all directions&mdash;a most
  beautiful sight."</p>

  <p>Panceri was of opinion that the mesenteric filaments were the organs of phosphorescence, but
  the whole question of the cause and localisation of the light in these colonies requires further
  investigation.</p>

  <p><b>Food.</b>&mdash;Very little is known about the food of Alcyonaria, but it is very probable
  that it consists entirely of minute larvae and other living organisms. When the coelenteric
  cavities of preserved Alcyonaria are examined, food is very rarely found in them, although
  fragments of Crustacean appendages have occasionally been seen in the neighbourhood of the
  mesenteric filaments. Experimenting upon <i>Alcyonium digitatum</i>, Miss Pratt<a id="NtA_369"
  href="#Nt_369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> has found that the zooids seize and swallow various small
  organisms of a surface-net gathering, and that they will also swallow finely minced fragments of
  the muscle of fish, but that they reject many kinds of fish ova. In many tropical and some
  extra-tropical species the superficial canal systems and the inter-mesenterial spaces of the
  zooids contain a large number of Zooxanthellae, and their presence seems to be associated in some
  cases with a decided degeneration of the digestive organs. It has been suggested that these
  symbiotic "Algae" prepare food materials after the manner of plants, and that these are absorbed
  by the hosts, but it appears improbable that in any case this source of food supply is sufficient.
  It must probably be supplemented in some degree by food obtained by the mouth, and digested in the
  coelenteric cavity.</p>

  <p>The question whether the Alcyonaria can form an important part of the dietary of fish or other
  carnivorous animals may be economically important. Fragments of the Pennatulid <i>Virgularia</i>
  have been found in the stomachs of cod and other fish, but with this exception there is no
  evidence that any genus is systematically or even occasionally preyed upon by any animal. With a
  very <span class="pagenum" id="page340"><span class="smaller">{340}</span></span>few exceptions
  Alcyonaria show no signs of having been torn, bitten, or wounded by carnivorous animals. It is
  improbable that the presence of nematocysts in the tentacles can account for this immunity, as it
  is known that some predaceous animals do feed upon Coelenterates provided with much larger
  nematocysts than any Alcyonarian possesses. All Alcyonaria, however, have a characteristic
  disagreeable odour, and it is possible, as in many other cases, that this is accompanied by an
  unpleasant taste. But if the Alcyonaria themselves are immune, it is possible that their large
  yolk-laden eggs may form a not unimportant source of food supply. In places where large colonies
  flourish, an immense number of eggs or embryos must be discharged into the water during the
  spawning season, and of these only a minute fraction can survive long enough to found a new
  colony.</p>

  <p><b>Reproduction.</b>&mdash;The formation of colonies by gemmation has frequently been mentioned
  above. The young buds of a colony arise from the endoderm canals in the body-wall of the zooids,
  in the general coenenchym, or in the stolon. They never arise from evagination of the coelenteric
  cavities of the zooids. There is no evidence that fission of a colony to form secondary colonies
  ever occurs. Gemmation leads to the increase in the number of zooids forming a colony, but not to
  an increase in the number of colonies.</p>

  <p>Fission of the zooids is of extremely rare occurrence; a single case, however, has been
  recorded by Studer in the genus <i>Gersemia</i>. Sexual reproduction usually occurs once in a
  year; it is doubtful whether it ever occurs continuously. The colonies appear to be nearly always
  dioecious, only one case of hermaphroditism having yet been recorded.<a id="NtA_370"
  href="#Nt_370"><sup>[370]</sup></a> The ova and sperm sacs are usually formed and matured on the
  six ventral mesenteries, rarely on the dorsal pair of mesenteries (Fig. 148, B) as well. The
  spawning season varies with the locality. <i>Alcyonium digitatum</i> spawns at Plymouth at the end
  of December, and somewhat later at Port Erin. The Pennatulid <i>Renilla</i> and the Gorgonid
  <i>Leptogorgia</i> spawn in the summer months on the coast of North America. In the Mediterranean
  <i>Alcyonium palmatum</i> spawns in September and October (Lo Bianco), <i>Gorgonia cavolinii</i>
  in May and June.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page341"><span class="smaller">{341}</span></span></div>

  <p>It is not known for certain when the fertilisation of the ova is effected, but in <i>Alcyonium
  digitatum</i>, and in the majority of the Alcyonarians, it probably takes place after the
  discharge of the ova from the zooids. A few forms are, however, certainly viviparous, the larvae
  of <i>Gorgonia capensis</i> being retained within the coelenteric cavity of the parent zooid until
  they have grown to a considerable size. The other viviparous Alcyonarians are <i>Corallium
  nobile</i> (de Lacaze Duthiers), the "Clavulaires petricoles," and <i>Sympodium coralloides</i>
  (Marion and Kowalevsky), and three species of <i>Nephthya</i> found at depths of 269 to 761
  fathoms (Koren and Danielssen). The general features of the development are very similar in all
  Alcyonarians that have been investigated. The egg contains a considerable amount of yolk, and
  undergoes a modified form of segmentation. The free-swimming larva is called a "sterrula." It
  consists of an outer layer of clear ciliated ectoderm cells, surrounding a solid endodermic
  plasmodium containing the yolk. As the yolk is consumed a cavity appears in the endoderm, and the
  larva is then called a "planula" (Fig. 150). The mouth is subsequently formed by an invagination
  of the ectoderm at the anterior pole. The development of the mesenteries has not yet been fully
  described.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Grade A. Protoalcyonacea.</b></p>

  <p>This Grade includes those genera which, like many sea-anemones, do not reproduce by continuous
  gemmation to form colonies.</p>

  <p>Several genera have been described, and they have been placed together in one family called the
  <b>Haimeidae</b>.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Haimea funebris</i>, M. Edwards, was found off the coast of Algeria; <i>H.
  hyalina</i>, Koren and Danielssen, in Norway; <i>Hartea elegans</i>, Wright, from the Irish coast;
  <i>Monoxenia darwinii</i>, Haeckel, from the Red Sea, and a large new species found by the
  "Siboga" Expedition in deep water off Ceram. All these species, however, are very rare, and there
  is no satisfactory evidence at present that they remain solitary throughout life.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Grade B. Synalcyonacea.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">The sub-division of the Synalcyonacea into orders presents many difficulties, and
  several different classifications have been proposed. Only two orders of the five that are here
  recognised are clearly defined, namely, the Coenothecalia, containing the single living genus
  <i>Heliopora</i>, and the Pennatulacea or Sea-pens; the others are connected by so many genera of
  intermediate characters that the determination of their limits is a matter of no little
  difficulty.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Stolonifera.</b></p>

  <p>These are colonial Alcyonaria springing from a membranous or ribbon-like stolon fixed to a
  stone or some other foreign object. The body-walls of the individual zooids may be free or
  connected by a series of horizontal bars or platforms (autothecalous); never continuously fused as
  they are in other orders (coenothecalous).</p>

  <p>In the simplest form of this order, <i>Sarcodictyon catenatum</i> Forbes, the ribbon-like
  strands of the stolon meander over the surface of stones, forming a red or yellow network, from
  the upper surface of which the clear transparent anthocodiae of the zooids protrude. When
  retracted the anthocodiae are drawn down below the surface of the general coenenchym, and their
  position is indicated by small cushion-like pads on the stolon. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page343"><span class="smaller">{343}</span></span><i>Sarcodictyon</i> is found in depths of 10
  to 22 fathoms in the Irish Sea, off the west coast of Scotland, the Shetlands, and off the
  Eddystone Lighthouse, South Devon.</p>

  <p>Another very important genus is <i>Tubipora</i>, in which the tubular body-wall of each zooid
  is very much longer in proportion to its diameter than it is in <i>Sarcodictyon</i>, and the
  anthocodia is retracted not into the stolon, but into the basal part of the body-wall. The zooids
  are connected together by horizontal platforms on which new zooids are formed by gemmation. Both
  horizontal platforms and the body-walls of the zooids are provided with a skeleton of fused
  spicules of a red colour.</p>

  <p>This genus is the well-known Organ-pipe coral, and is found sometimes in immense quantities on
  the coral reefs of both the old and new world.</p>

  <p>It may be seen in pools on the edge of the reefs at low tides in colonies frequently a foot or
  more in diameter. The tentacles are often of a bright emerald green colour, and as the anthocodiae
  stand expanded in the clear water they contribute a brilliant patch of colour to the many beauties
  of their surroundings. When the coral is disturbed, or the water shallows and the anthocodiae are
  retracted, the dull red colour of the skeleton gradually takes the place of the bright green of
  the tentacles.</p>

  <p>It is probable that this order of Alcyonaria was better represented on the reefs of some of the
  earlier periods of the world's history than it is at present. The fossil <i>Syringopora</i>, which
  is found abundantly in the carboniferous limestone and other strata, was probably an Alcyonarian
  belonging to this order. It resembles <i>Tubipora</i> in its mode of growth, but in place of the
  horizontal platforms connecting the zooids there are rods or bars from which new zooids spring
  (Fig. 152). Similar connecting bars are found in the recent <i>Clavularia</i> (<i>Hicksonia</i>,
  Delage) <span class="pagenum" id="page344"><span class="smaller">{344}</span></span><i>viridis</i>
  of the East Indian reefs (Fig. 153). Other fossil forms belonging to the order are

  </div>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Coenothecalia.</b></p>

  <p>This order contains the single genus and species <i>Heliopora coerulea</i> among recent corals,
  but was probably represented by a large number of genera and species in earlier periods.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page345"><span class="smaller">{345}</span></span></div>

  <p>It is found at the present day in many localities in the warm shallow waters of the tropical
  Pacific and Indian Oceans. It usually flourishes on the inside of the reef, and may form masses of
  stone five or six feet in diameter. The coral may easily be recognised, as it is the only one that
  exhibits a blue colour. This colour usually penetrates the whole skeleton, but in some forms is
  absent from the superficial layers.</p>

  <p>The skeleton consists of a number of parallel tubes with imperforate walls, which are fused
  together in honey-comb fashion. On making a vertical section through a branch of the coral it is
  found that the tubes are divided into a series of chambers by transverse partitions or "tabulae."
  The soft living tissues of the coral, the zooids and coenosarc, are confined to the terminal
  chambers, all the lower parts being simply dead calcareous skeleton supporting the living
  superficial layer. Among the parallel tubes there may be found a number of larger chambers that
  seem to have been formed by the destruction of the adjacent walls of groups of about nineteen
  tubes. These chambers are provided with a variable number of pseudo-septa, and have a remarkable
  resemblance to the thecae of some Zoantharian corals. That <i>Heliopora</i> is not a Zoantharian
  coral was first definitely proved by Moseley, who showed that each of these larger chambers
  contains an Alcyonarian zooid with eight pinnate tentacles and eight mesenteries. The zooids arise
  from a sheet of coenosarc that covers the whole of the living branches of the coral mass, and this
  sheet of coenosarc bears a plexus of canals communicating on the one hand with the zooids, and on
  the other with a series of blind sacs, each of which occupies the cavity of one of the skeletal
  tubes as far down as the first tabula. The zooids of <i>Heliopora</i> are very rarely expanded
  during the day-time, and it has been found very difficult to get them to expand in an aquarium.
  The coral, however, is frequently infested with a tubicolous worm allied to the genus
  <i>Leucodora</i>, which freely expands and projects from the surface. So constant and so numerous
  are these worms in some localities that it has actually been suggested that <i>Heliopora</i>
  should be regarded as a Polychaete worm and not as an Alcyonarian. According to Mr. Stanley
  Gardiner, however, these worms do not occur in association with the <i>Heliopora</i> found on the
  reefs of the Maldive Archipelago.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page346"><span class="smaller">{346}</span></span></div>

  <p>There is very strong reason to believe that certain fossil corals were closely related to
  <i>Heliopora</i>; that <i>Heliopora</i> is in fact the solitary survivor of a group of Alcyonarian
  corals that in past times was well represented on the reefs, both in numbers and in species. The
  evidence is not so convincing that other fossil corals are closely related to <i>Heliopora</i>,
  and their true zoological position may remain a matter for surmise. The order may be classified as

  <p class="sp3">The family <b>Coccoseridae</b> is regarded by Lindstr&ouml;m as a sub-family of the

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order III. Alcyonacea.</b></p>

  <p>This order contains a large number of genera of great variety of form. The only characters
  which unite the different genera are that the body-walls of some groups of zooids, or of all the
  zooids, are fused together to form a common coenenchym penetrated by the coenosarcal canals, and
  that the spicules do not fuse to form a solid calcareous, or horny and calcareous, axial skeletal
  support.</p>

  <p>The affinities with the order Stolonifera are clearly seen in the genera <i>Xenia</i> and
  <i>Telesto</i>. Some species of <i>Xenia</i> form flattened or domed colonies attached to stones
  or corals, with non-retractile anthocodiae and body-walls united for only a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page347"><span class="smaller">{347}</span></span>short distance at the base. Young
  <i>Xenia</i> colonies are in fact Stolonifera in all essential characters. In <i>Telesto
  prolifera</i> we find a network of stolons encrusting coral branches and other objects after the
  manner of the stolons of many species of <i>Clavularia</i>, although the zooids do not arise from
  these stolons singly, but in groups, with their body-walls fused together for a certain distance.
  In <i>Telesto rubra</i> the spicules of the body-walls are fused together to form a series of
  perforated tubes very similar in some respects to the tubes of <i>Tubipora</i>.</p>

  <p>A remarkable genus is <i>Coelogorgia</i>. Here we find a branching colony arising from a basal
  stolon, and the axis of the main stem and of each branch consists of a single very much elongated
  zooid bearing on its thickened walls the branches of the next series and other zooids. It is true
  that in this genus there is very little fusion of neighbouring zooids, and the amount of true
  coenenchym is so small that it can hardly be said to exist at all. Bourne<a id="NtA_373"

  Asiphonacea, which he joins with the Pennatulida in the order Stelechotokea; but their affinities
  seem to be closer with the Alcyonacea than with the Pennatulacea, from which they differ in many
  important characters.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 154.</span>&mdash;<i>Alcyonium digitatum</i>, a
      single-lobed specimen, with some of the zooids expanded.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The genus <i>Alcyonium</i> not only contains the commonest British Alcyonarian (<i>A.
  digitatum</i>), but it is one of the most widely distributed genera of all Alcyonaria that occur
  in shallow water.</p>

  <p>The genera <i>Sarcophytum</i> and <i>Lobophytum</i> occur in shallow water in the tropics of
  the old world. The former frequently consists of huge toad-stool shaped masses, soft and spongy in
  <span class="pagenum" id="page348"><span class="smaller">{348}</span></span>consistency, of a
  green, brown, or yellow colour. On some reefs the colonies of <i>Sarcophytum</i> form a very
  conspicuous feature, and from their very slimy, slippery surface, add to the minor dangers of
  wading in these regions. Both genera are dimorphic. Some species of the genus
  <i>Sclerophytum</i>,<a id="NtA_374" href="#Nt_374"><sup>[374]</sup></a> which occur in the Indian
  Ocean, are so hard and brittle that they might readily be mistaken for a Zoantharian coral. This
  character is due to the enormous number of tightly packed spicules borne by the coenenchym. Some
  of these spicules in <i>S. querciforme</i> are 7 mm. &times; 1.7 mm.; the largest, though not the
  longest (<i>vide</i> p. <a href="#page335">335</a>) of any spicules occurring in the order.</p>

  <p>Another very important genus occurring on coral reefs, and of very wide distribution, is
  <i>Spongodes</i>. This genus forms bushy and rather brittle colonies of an endless variety of
  beautiful shapes and colours. Arising from the neck of each anthocodia there are one or two long,
  sharp, projecting spicules, which give the surface a very spiny or prickly character.</p>

  <p>The genera <i>Siphonogorgia</i> and <i>Chironephthya</i> form large brittle, branching colonies
  which might readily be mistaken for Gorgonians. The strength of the branches, however, is mainly
  due to the large, densely packed, spindle-shaped spicules at the surface of the coenenchym, the
  long coelenteric cavities of the zooids penetrating the axis of both stem and branches.
  <i>Siphonogorgia</i> is usually uniformly red or yellow in colour. <i>Chironephthya</i>, on the
  other hand, exhibits a great variety of colour in specimens from the same reef, and indeed in
  different branches of the same colony.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Xeniidae.</b>&mdash;Alcyonacea with non-retractile zooids. Spicules very small
  discs, usually containing a relatively small proportion of lime.</p>

  <p><i>Xenia</i>, Savigny; Indian Ocean and Torres Straits. <i>Heteroxenia</i>, K&ouml;lliker; Red Sea,
  Cape of Good Hope, and Torres Straits.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Telestidae.</b>&mdash;Colonies arising from an encrusting membranous or branching
  stolon. The erect stem and branches are formed by the body-walls of two or three zooids only, from
  which secondary zooids and branches of the next order arise.</p>

  <p><i>Telesto</i>, Lamouroux, widely distributed in warm waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and
  Indian Oceans. The genus <i>Fascicularia</i>, Viguier, from the coast of Algiers, seems to be
  related to <i>Telesto</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="page349"><span
  class="smaller">{349}</span></span>but the groups of zooids are short, and do not give rise to
  branches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Coelogorgiidae.</b>&mdash;The colony arborescent, attached by stolon-like processes.
  The stem formed by an axial zooid with thickened body-walls. Branches formed by axial zooids of
  the second order, and branchlets by axial zooids of the third order, borne either on two sides or
  in spirals by the main stem. Genus <i>Coelogorgia</i>, Zanzibar.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Alcyoniidae.</b>&mdash;The colonies of this family are usually soft and fleshy, and
  the spicules, evenly distributed throughout the coenenchym, do not usually fuse or interlock to
  form a continuous solid skeleton. They may be unbranched or lobed, never dendritic in form. The
  principal genera are:&mdash;<i>Alcyonium</i>, Linnaeus, cosmopolitan, but principally distributed
  in temperate and cold waters. <i>Alcyonium digitatum</i> is the commonest British Alcyonarian. It
  is found in shallow water, from the pools left at low spring tides to depths of 40 or 50 fathoms,
  at most places on the British shores. It is stated by Koehler to descend into depths of over 300
  fathoms in the Bay of Biscay. There are two principal varieties; one is white or pale pink in the
  living condition, and the other yellow. In some localities the two varieties may be found in the
  same pools. Another species, <i>Alcyonium glomeratum</i>, placed in a distinct genus
  (<i>Rhodophyton</i>) by Gray, and distinguished from the common species by its red colour and long
  digitate lobes, is found only off the coast of Cornwall. <i>Paralcyonium</i>, Milne Edwards;
  Mediterranean. <i>Sclerophytum</i>, Pratt; sometimes dimorphic, Indian Ocean. <i>Sarcophytum</i>,
  Lesson; dimorphic, principally tropical. <i>Lolophytum</i>, Marenzeller; dimorphic, tropical.
  <i>Anthomastus</i>, Verrill; dimorphic, Atlantic Ocean, deep water. <i>Acrophytum</i>, Hickson;
  dimorphic, Cape of Good Hope.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Nephthyidae.</b>&mdash;Colonies dendritic. Usually soft and flexible in consistency.

  fathoms.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order IV. Gorgonacea.</b></p>

  <p>This order contains a very large number of dendritic and usually flexible corals occurring in
  nearly all seas and extending from shallow waters to the very great depths of the ocean. A large
  proportion of them are brightly coloured, and as the principal pigments are fixed in the spicules,
  and are therefore preserved when the corals are dead and dried, they afford some of the most
  attractive and graceful objects of a natural history museum.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The only character that separates them from the Alcyonacea is that they possess a
  skeletal axis that is not perforated by the coelenteric cavities of the zooids. The coelenteric
  cavities are usually short. The order may conveniently be divided into two sub-orders.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order 1. Pseudaxonia.</b></p>

  <p>The axis in this sub-order consists of numerous spicules tightly packed together, or cemented
  together by a substance which is probably allied to horn in its chemical composition. This
  substance may be considerable in amount, in which case it remains after decalcification as a
  spongy, porous residue; or it may be so small in amount, as in <i>Corallium</i>, that the axis
  appears to be composed of solid carbonate of lime. The statement is usually made that the axis is
  penetrated by nutritive canals in certain genera, but the evidence upon which this is based is
  unsatisfactory and in some cases unfounded. There can be no doubt, however, that in some genera
  the axis is porous and in others it is not, and this forms a useful character for the separation
  of genera.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Briareidae.</b>&mdash;The medullary substance consists of closely packed but
  separate spicules embedded in a soft horny matrix, which is uniform in character throughout its
  course. Nearly all the genera form dendritic colonies of considerable size.</p>

  <p>The principal genera are:&mdash;<i>Solenocaulon</i>, Gray; Indian Ocean and North Australia.
  Many of the specimens of this genus have fistulose stems and branches. The tubular character of
  the stem and branches is probably caused by the activity of a Crustacean, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page351"><span class="smaller">{351}</span></span><i>Alpheus</i>, and may be regarded as of
  the nature of a gall-formation.<a id="NtA_376" href="#Nt_376"><sup>[376]</sup></a>
  <i>Paragorgia</i>, M. Edwards; Norwegian fjords, in deep water. This genus forms very large
  tree-like colonies of a ruby-red or white colour. It is perhaps the largest of the dendritic
  Alcyonarians. It is dimorphic. <i>Spongioderma</i>, K&ouml;lliker; Cape of Good Hope. The surface of
  this form is always covered by an encrusting sponge. <i>Iciligorgia</i>, Ridley; Torres Straits.
  The stem and branches are compressed and irregular in section.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Sclerogorgiidae.</b>&mdash;The medullary mass forms a distinct axis consisting of
  closely packed elongate spicules with dense horny sheaths.</p>

  <p><i>Suberogorgia</i>, Gray, has a wide distribution in the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the
  West Indies. <i>Keroeides</i>, W. and S., comes from Japan.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Melitodidae.</b>&mdash;The axis in this family exhibits a series of nodes and
  internodes (Fig. 155), the former consisting of pads formed of a horny substance with embedded
  spicules, the latter of a calcareous substance with only traces of a horny matrix. The internodes
  are quite rigid, the nodes however give a certain degree of flexibility to the colony as a whole.
  Neither the nodes nor the internodes are penetrated by nutritive canals, but when dried the nodes
  are porous.</p>

  <p>The principal genera are:&mdash;<i>Melitodes</i>, Verrill; widely distributed in the Indian and
  Pacific Oceans, Cape of Good Hope, etc. This genus is in some localities extremely abundant and
  exhibits great brilliancy and variety of colour. The branching is usually dichotomous at the
  nodes. <i>Wrightella</i>, Gray. This is a delicate dwarf form from Mauritius and the coast of
  South Africa. <i>Parisis</i>, Verrill; Pacific Ocean from Formosa to Australia but not very
  common. One species from Mauritius. The branches arise from the internodes.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page352"><span class="smaller">{352}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Coralliidae.</b>&mdash;The axis is formed by the fusion of spicules into a dense,
  solid, inflexible, calcareous core.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Corallium</i>, Lamarck. <i>Corallium nobile</i>, Pallas, the "precious coral,"
  occurs in the Mediterranean, chiefly off the coast of North Africa, but also on the coasts of

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order 2. Axifera.</b></p>

  <p>The axis in this sub-order may be horny, or horny with a core of calcium carbonate, or composed
  of horn impregnated with calcium carbonate, or of nodes of horn alternating with internodes of
  calcium carbonate. It may be distinguished from the axis of the Pseudaxonia by the fact that in no
  case have definite spicules been observed to take part in its formation. It has been suggested
  that as the Axifera represent a line of descent distinct from that of the Pseudaxonia they should
  be placed in a separate order. Apart from the character of the axis, however, the two sub-orders
  show so many affinities in their general anatomy that it is better to regard the two lines of
  descent as united within the Gorgonacean limit. It is very improbable that the two groups sprang
  independently from a stoloniferous ancestor.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Isidae.</b>&mdash;This family includes all those Axifera in which the axis is
  composed of alternate nodes of horn and internodes of calcareous substance.</p>

  <p>There can be little doubt of the close affinities of many of the genera of this family with the
  Melitodidae among the Pseudaxonia. In both the coenenchym is thin and the coelenteric cavities
  short. No important differences have been observed between the structure of the zooids of the two
  families, and now that we know that the "nutritive canals" of <i>Melitodes</i> do not perforate
  the nodes there is no important difference left between the coenosarcal canal systems. The
  structure and method of calcification of the internodes of the two families are very similar. The
  main difference between them is that the nodes of the Isidae are purely horny, whereas in the
  Melitodidae the horny substance of the nodes contains calcareous spicules.</p>

  <p>The principal genera are:&mdash;<i>Isis</i>, Linnaeus; Pacific Ocean. This genus forms
  substantial fan-shaped colonies with, relatively, a thick coenenchym, short stout internodes and
  black horny nodes. <i>Mopsea</i>, Lamouroux; Coast of Australia. The verrucae are club-shaped and
  are arranged in spiral rows round the stem. <i>Acanella</i>, Gray; principally found in deep water
  in the Atlantic Ocean but also in the Pacific. The internodes are long and the branches arise from
  the nodes. Most of the species occur in deep water, some in very deep water (<i>A. simplex</i>,
  1600 to 1700 fathoms). In this and the following genera the coenenchym is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page354"><span class="smaller">{354}</span></span>thin and the zooids imperfectly or not
  retractile. <i>Ceratoisis</i>, Wright; Atlantic Ocean, extending from shallow to deep water. The
  branches arise from the nodes. <i>Chelidonisis</i>, Studer; deep water off the Azores.
  <i>Isidella</i>, Gray; Mediterranean Sea. <i>Bathygorgia</i>, Wright; off Yokohama, 2300 fathoms.
  This genus is unbranched, with very long internodes and short nodes. The zooids are arranged on
  one side only of the stem.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Primnoidae.</b>&mdash;This is a well-marked family. The axis of the colonies is
  horny and calcareous. The coenenchym and the non-retractile zooids are protected by scale-like
  spicules, which usually overlap and form a complete armour for the protection of the soft parts.
  On the aboral side of the base of each tentacle there is a specialised scale, and these fit
  together, when the tentacles are folded over the peristome, to form an operculum.</p>

  <p>The principal genera are:&mdash;<i>Primnoa</i>, Lamouroux; Atlantic Ocean, occurring also in
  the Norwegian fjords. This genus is usually found in moderately deep water, 100 to 500 fathoms.
  <i>Primnoella</i>, Gray. This genus seems to be confined to the temperate seas of the southern
  hemisphere. It is unbranched. The zooids are arranged in whorls round the long whip-like stem.
  <i>Plumarella</i>, Gray; southern hemisphere, in moderately deep water. This is branched pinnately
  in one plane. The zooids are small and arise at considerable intervals alternately on the sides of
  the branches. <i>Stenella</i>, Gray; widely distributed in deep water. The zooids are large and
  are arranged in whorls of three situated at considerable distances apart. <i>Stachyodes</i>, W.
  and S.; Fiji, Kermadecs, Azores, in deep water. Colony feebly branched. Zooids in regular whorls
  of five. Other genera belonging to this group of Primnoidae are <i>Thouarella</i>, Gray, and
  <i>Amphilaphis</i>, Antarctic seas.</p>

  <p>The following genera are placed in separate sub-families:&mdash;<i>Callozostron</i>, Wright;
  Antarctic Sea, 1670 fathoms. The axis is procumbent and the zooids are thickly set in rows on its
  upper surface. The zooids are protected by large imbricate scales, of which those of the last row
  are continued into long spine-like processes. <i>Calyptrophora</i>, Gray; Pacific Ocean, in deep
  water. The base of the zooids is protected by two remarkably large scales. <i>Primnoides</i>, W.
  and S.; Southern Ocean. The opercular scales are not distinctly differentiated and the calyx is
  therefore imperfectly protected.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page355"><span class="smaller">{355}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Chrysogorgiidae.</b><a id="NtA_384" href="#Nt_384"><sup>[384]</sup></a>&mdash;The
  axis in this family is composed of a horny fibrous substance with interstratified calcareous
  particles, and it springs from a calcareous plate, which sometimes gives off root-like processes.
  It may be unbranched or branched in such a way that the branches of the second, third, and
  subsequent orders assume in turn the direction of the base of the main axis. The axis is
  frequently of a metallic iridescent appearance. The zooids usually arise in a single straight or
  spiral row on the branches, and are not retractile. The coenenchym is thin. The spicules vary
  considerably, but in a very large proportion of the species they are thin, oval, or hour-glass
  plates (Fig. 149, <span class="smaller">10</span>, p. <a href="#page336">336</a>).</p>

  <p>By some authors this family is considered to be the simplest and most primitive of the Axifera;
  but the delicate character of the axis of the main stem and branches, the thinness of the
  coenenchym, the position of the zooids on one side of the branches only, and the tenuity of the
  calcareous spicules may be all accounted not as primitive characters, but as special adaptations
  to the life in the slow uniform currents of deep water.</p>

  <p>The principal genera are:&mdash;<i>Lepidogorgia</i>, Verrill; Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, 300
  to 1600 fathoms. Axis unbranched. Zooids large and arranged in a single row. <i>Trichogorgia</i>,
  Hickson; Cape of Good Hope, 56 fathoms. Colony branching in one plane. Zooids numerous and on all
  sides of the branches. <i>Chrysogorgia</i>, D. and M.; deep water. Axis branched. Spicules on the
  zooids always large. <i>Metallogorgia</i>, Versluys; Atlantic Ocean, 400 to 900 fathoms. Basal
  part of the stem unbranched (monopodial). <i>Iridogorgia</i>, Verrill. Spiral stem and branches.
  <i>Pleurogorgia</i>, Versluys. Axis branched in one plane. Coenenchym thick. <i>Riisea</i>, D. and
  M. Monopodial stem and thick coenenchym.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Muriceidae.</b>&mdash;This is a large family, exhibiting very great variety of
  habit. The spicules are often very spiny, and project beyond the surface of the ectoderm, giving
  the colony a rough appearance. A great number of genera have been described, but none of them are
  very well known. The family requires careful revision.</p>

  <p>The more important genera are:&mdash;<i>Acanthogorgia</i>, Gray; principally in deep water in
  the Atlantic Ocean. The calices are <span class="pagenum" id="page356"><span
  class="smaller">{356}</span></span>large, cylindrical, and spiny. <i>Villogorgia</i>, D. and M.;
  widely distributed. Delicate, graceful forms, with thin coenenchym. <i>Echinomuricea</i>, Verrill;
  <i>Muricea</i>, Lamouroux; <i>Paramuricea</i>, K&ouml;ll; <i>Acamptogorgia</i>, W. and S.;
  <i>Bebryce</i>, Philippi.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Plexauridae.</b>&mdash;In this family we find some of the largest and most
  substantial Gorgonids. The axis is usually black, but its horny substance may be impregnated with
  lime, particularly at the base. The coenenchym is thick, and the zooids are usually completely
  retractile, and the surface smooth. The species of the family are principally found in shallow
  water in warm or tropical regions.</p>

  <p>The principal genera are:&mdash;<i>Eunicea</i>, Lamouroux. The calices are prominent, and not
  retractile. <i>Plexaura</i>, Lamouroux; <i>Euplexaura</i>, Verrill. <i>Eunicella</i>, Verrill.
  With an outer layer of peculiar torch-shaped spicules. The only British species of this order is
  <i>Eunicella cavolini</i> (formerly called <i>Gorgonia verrucosa</i>). It is found in depths of 10
  to 20 fathoms off the coast of the English Channel and west of Scotland. Occasionally specimens
  are found in which a gall-like malformation with a circular aperture is seen, containing a
  Barnacle. Such gall formations, common enough in some species of Madreporaria, are rarely found in
  Alcyonaria.</p>

  and thin coenenchym. The zooids are usually completely retractile.</p>

  <p>The principal genera are:&mdash;<i>Gorgonia</i>, Linn.  This genus <span class="pagenum"
  id="page357"><span class="smaller">{357}</span></span>includes <i>Gorgonia</i>
  (<i>Rhipidogorgia</i>) <i>flabellum</i>, the well-known fan Gorgonia with intimately anastomosing
  branches, from the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The genera <i>Eugorgia</i>, Verrill, and
  <i>Leptogorgia</i>, Milne Edwards, differ from <i>Gorgonia</i> in the character of the spicules.
  In <i>Xiphigorgia</i>, Milne Edwards, from the West Indies, the branches are much compressed,
  forming at the edges wing-like ridges, which bear the zoopores in rows. <i>Malacogorgia</i>,
  Hickson, has no spicules. Cape of Good Hope.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Gorgonellidae.</b>&mdash;In this family the horny axis is impregnated with lime. The
  surface of the coenenchym is usually smooth, and the spicules small. The colonies are sometimes
  unbranched (<i>Juncella</i>). In the branching forms the axis of the terminal branches is often
  very fine and thread-like in dimensions.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The principal genera are:&mdash;<i>Gorgonella</i>, with a ramified flabelliform
  axis; <i>Ctenocella</i>, with a peculiar double-comb manner of branching; and <i>Juncella</i>,
  which forms very long unbranched or slightly branched colonies, with club-shaped spicules. All
  these genera are found in shallow water in the tropical or semi-tropical regions of the world.
  <i>Verrucella</i> is a genus with delicate anastomosing branches found principally in the shallow
  tropical waters of the Atlantic shores. Like many of the Gorgonacea, with branches disposed in one
  plane (flabelliform) <i>Verrucella</i> frequently carries a considerable number of epizoic Brittle
  stars, which wind their flexible arms round the branches, and thus obtain a firm attachment to
  their host. There is no reason to suppose that these Brittle stars are in any sense parasitic, as
  a specimen that bears many such forms shows no sign of injury or degeneration, and it is possible
  they may even be of service to <span class="pagenum" id="page358"><span

  might be injurious. An interesting feature of the association is that the Brittle stars are of the
  same colour as the host, and the knob-like plates on their aboral surface have a close resemblance
  to the verrucae (Fig. 157).</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order V. Pennatulacea.</b></p>

  <p>The Sea-pens form a very distinct order of the Alcyonaria. They are the only Alcyonarians that
  are not strictly sedentary in habit, that are capable of independent movement as a whole, and
  exhibit a bilateral symmetry of the colony. No genera have yet been discovered that can be
  regarded as connecting links between the Pennatulacea and the other orders of the Alcyonaria.
  Their position, therefore, is an isolated one, and their relationships obscure.</p>

  <p>The peculiarities of the order are due to the great growth and modification in structure of the
  first formed zooid of the colony. This zooid (Oozooid, Hauptpolyp, or Axial zooid) increases
  greatly in length, develops very thick fleshy walls, usually loses its tentacles, digestive
  organs, and frequently its mouth, exhibits profound modification of its system of mesenteries, and
  in other ways becomes adapted to its function of supporting the whole colony.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig158.jpg"><img style="width:21%" src="images/fig158.jpg" alt="fig158"

      composed of a row of autozooids; <i>R</i>, rachis; <i>St</i>, stalk; <i>T</i>, anthocodia of
      the axial zooid, usually suppressed. (After Jungersen.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The axial zooid shows from an early stage of development a division into two regions: a distal
  region which produces by gemmation on the body-wall numerous secondary zooids, and becomes the
  rachis of the colony; and a proximal region which becomes the stalk or peduncle, and does not
  produce buds (Fig. 158). The secondary zooids are of two kinds: <span class="pagenum"
  id="page359"><span class="smaller">{359}</span></span>the autozooids and the siphonozooids. The
  former have the ordinary characters of an Alcyonarian zooid, and produce sexual cells; the latter
  have no tentacles, a reduced mesenteric system, and a stomodaeum provided with a very wide
  siphonoglyph.</p>

  <p>The arrangement of the autozooids and siphonozooids upon the axial zooid is subject to great
  modifications, and affords the principal character for the classification of the order. In the
  Pennatuleae the autozooids are arranged in two bilaterally disposed rows on the rachis, forming
  the leaves or pinnae of the colony (Fig. 158). The number in each leaf increases during the growth
  of the colony by the addition of new zooids in regular succession from the dorsal to the ventral
  side of the rachis<a id="NtA_385" href="#Nt_385"><sup>[385]</sup></a> (Fig. 159). In other
  Pennatulacea the autozooids are arranged in rows which do not unite to form leaves
  (<i>Funiculina</i>), in a tuft at the extremity of a long peduncle (<i>Umbellula</i>), scattered
  on the dorsal side of the rachis (<i>Renilla</i>, Fig. 160), or scattered on all sides of the
  rachis (<i>Cavernularia</i>, Fig. 161). In those forms in which the autozooids are scattered the
  bilateral symmetry of the colony as a whole becomes obscured. The siphonozooids may be found on
  the leaves (<i>Pteroeides</i>), but more frequently between the leaves or rows of autozooids, or
  scattered irregularly among the autozooids. Usually the siphonozooids are of one kind only, but in
  <i>Pennatula murrayi</i> there is one specially modified siphonozooid at the base of each leaf,<a
  id="NtA_386" href="#Nt_386"><sup>[386]</sup></a> which appears to have some special but unknown
  function.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In <i>Umbellula gracilis</i> each siphonozooid bears a single pinnate tentacle, and in some
  other species of the same genus there is a tentacle which is not pinnate.<a id="NtA_387"
  href="#Nt_387"><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page360"><span class="smaller">{360}</span></span></div>

  <p>The zooids and coenenchym are usually protected by a crust of coloured or colourless, long,
  smooth, needle-like, calcareous spicules, situated principally in the superficial layer, so as to
  leave the subjacent tissues soft and spongy in texture. In some cases the spicules are smooth
  double clubs, rods, discs, or irregular granules, and in <i>Sarcophyllum</i>, <i>Chunella</i>,
  some species of <i>Umbellula</i> and others, there is no calcareous skeleton. The tuberculated
  spindles, so common in other Alcyonaria, are not found in any species. In most genera a horny, or
  calcified horny rod is embedded in the central part of the axial polyp, serving as a backbone or
  support for its muscles. It is absent, however, in <i>Renilla</i>, and reduced or absent in
  <i>Cavernularia</i>.</p>

  <p>The sexual organs are borne by the mesenteries of the autozooids only, and each colony is
  either male or female. There is no record of hermaphroditism in the order. The eggs contain a
  considerable amount of yolk, and fertilisation is effected in the sea-water after their discharge.
  The segmentation is irregular, and the free-swimming ciliated larva (of <i>Renilla</i>) shows the
  rudiments of the first buds from the axial polyp before it settles down in the mud.</p>

  <p>The Sea-pens are usually found on muddy or sandy sea-bottoms, from a depth of a few fathoms to
  the greatest depths of the ocean. It is generally assumed that their normal position is one with
  the peduncle embedded in the mud and the rachis erect. Positive evidence of this was given by
  Rumphius, writing in 1741, in the case of <i>Virgularia rumphii</i> and <i>V. juncea</i> at
  Amboina,<a id="NtA_388" href="#Nt_388"><sup>[388]</sup></a> and by Darwin in the case of
  <i>Stylatula darwinii</i> at Bahia Blanca.<a id="NtA_389" href="#Nt_389"><sup>[389]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"At low water," writes Darwin, "hundreds of these zoophytes might be seen projecting like
  stubble, with the truncate end upwards, a few inches above the surface of the muddy sand. When
  touched or pulled they suddenly drew themselves in with force so as nearly or quite to
  disappear."</p>

  <p>It is not known whether the Pennatulids have the power of moving from place to place when the
  local conditions become unfavourable. It is quite probable that they have this power, but the
  accounts given of the Sea-pens lying flat on the sand do not appear to be founded on direct
  observation. The fable of <span class="pagenum" id="page361"><span
  class="smaller">{361}</span></span><i>Pennatula</i> swimming freely "with all its delicate
  transparent polypi expanded, and emitting their usual brilliant phosphorescent light, sailing
  through the still and dark abyss by the regular and synchronous pulsations of the minute fringed
  arms of the whole polypi," appears to be based on a statement made by Bohadsch in 1761, and
  picturesque though it be, is undoubtedly erroneous.</p>

  <p>The brilliant phosphorescence of many species of Pennatulacea has been observed by many
  naturalists, and it is very probable that they all exhibit this property to some degree. The
  phosphorescence appears to be emitted by the mesenteric filaments of the autozooids, but it is not
  yet determined whether the phenomenon is confined to these organs or is more generally
  distributed.</p>

  <p>The Pennatulacea are usually devoid of epizoites, but occasionally the parasitic or
  semi-parasitic Entomostracan <i>Lamippe</i> is found in the zooids. A small crab is also
  frequently found between the large leaves of species of <i>Pteroeides</i>. The most remarkable
  case of symbiosis, however, has recently been observed in the form of an encrusting Gymnoblastic
  Hydroid<a id="NtA_390" href="#Nt_390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> living on the free edge of the leaves
  of a species of <i>Ptilosarcus</i>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The order Pennatulacea is divided into four sections.</p>

  <p><b>Sect. 1. Pennatuleae.</b>&mdash;In this section the colony is distinctly bilaterally
  symmetrical, and the autozooids are arranged in rows with their body-walls fused to form
  leaves.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Pteroeides</i>, the representative genus of the family <b>Pteroeididae</b>, is a
  fleshy Sea-pen found in shallow sea water in the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean and in the
  Mediterranean. It has large leaves with long spiny, projecting spicules, and the siphonozooids are
  borne by the leaves. <i>Pennatula</i>, the representative genus of the family <b>Pennatulidae</b>,
  has a wider distribution in area and in depth. <i>Pennatula phosphorea</i> is a common British
  species, found in depths of 10 to 20 fathoms in many localities off our coasts. It is about 5
  inches in length. There are several varieties of this species distributed in Atlantic waters.
  <i>Pennatula grandis</i> is a magnificent species found in Norwegian fjords, in the Faeroe
  Channel, and off the northern coasts of N. America, in depths of from 50 to 1255 fathoms.
  Specimens have been <span class="pagenum" id="page362"><span
  class="smaller">{362}</span></span>obtained no less than 2&frac12; feet in length. <i>P. murrayi</i> and
  <i>P. naresi</i> are species of the genus found at depths of a few hundred fathoms in tropical
  seas.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Virgularia</i>, belonging to the family <b>Virgulariidae</b>, is represented in
  the British seas by <i>V. mirabilis</i>, a long slender Sea-pen found in many localities off the
  Scottish coasts.</p>

  <p><b>Sect. 2. Spicatae.</b>&mdash;This section includes those Sea-pens in which the autozooids
  are arranged bilaterally on the axial zooid in rows or more irregularly, but do not unite to form
  leaves. It is a large section and contains many widely divergent genera.</p>

  <p>The family <b>Funiculinidae</b> is represented on our coasts by <i>Funiculina
  quadrangularis</i>, a long and slender Sea-pen 2 to 3 feet in length. The autozooids are arranged
  in oblique rows, and the siphonozooids are on the ventral side of the rachis. There is one point
  of special interest in this genus. The siphonozooids appear to change as the colony grows and to
  become autozooids. If this is the case it may be more correct to describe the genus as devoid of
  true siphonozooids.</p>

  <p>The family <b>Anthoptilidae</b> contains the species <i>Anthoptilum grandiflorum</i>, which has
  a wide distribution in depths of 130 to 500 fathoms in the N. and S. Atlantic Ocean. It is perhaps
  the largest of all the Pennatulacea, specimens having been obtained from the Cape of Good Hope
  over 4 feet long with expanded autozooids, each more than half an inch in length.</p>

  <p>The family <b>Kophobelemnonidae</b> contains a number of forms with remarkably large autozooids
  arranged in irregular rows on the two sides of the rachis. The siphonozooids are numerous and
  scattered, and their position is indicated by small papilliform calices on the coenenchym. The
  surface of these pens is usually rough, owing to the presence of numerous coarse projecting
  spicules. <i>Kophobelemnon</i> occurs in the Mediterranean in deep water, off the coasts of
  Ireland and Scotland, and in other regions.</p>

  <p>The family <b>Umbellulidae</b> contains some of the most remarkable and interesting examples of
  the deep-sea fauna. The peduncle is very long and the rachis stunted and expanded. The autozooids
  are of great size, non-retractile, and arranged in a cluster or rosette on the terminal rachis.
  There is a wide structural range between the species. Some species have numerous large spicules,
  others have none. In some species the siphonozooids have a single pinnate or digitate tentacle, in
  others the siphonozooids <span class="pagenum" id="page363"><span
  class="smaller">{363}</span></span>are of the usual type. <i>Umbellula</i> appears to be a
  somewhat rare but cosmopolitan genus in deep water, extending from the Arctic to the Antarctic
  region in water ranging from 200 to 2500 fathoms.</p>

  <p>The interesting genus <i>Chunella</i> was discovered by the German "Valdivia" Expedition at a
  depth of about 420 fathoms off the coast of E. Africa, and subsequently by the Dutch "Siboga"
  Expedition at a depth of about 500 fathoms in the Malay Archipelago. According to K&uuml;kenthal,<a
  id="NtA_391" href="#Nt_391"><sup>[391]</sup></a> this genus with another closely allied genus
  <i>Amphianthus</i> should form a new section of Pennatulacea, the <b>Verticilladeae</b>.
  <i>Chunella</i> has a long and very delicate rachis and peduncle, and the former terminates in a
  single autozooid and has five or six whorls of three autozooids, situated at considerable
  distances from one another. Spicules are absent. The full description of this genus has not yet
  been published, but it is clear that it occupies a very isolated position in the order.</p>

  <p><b>Sect. 3. Renilleae.</b>&mdash;This section contains a single family <b>Renillidae</b> and a
  single genus <i>Renilla</i> (Fig. 160). The rachis is expanded into a flattened cordate form set
  at an angle to the peduncle, and the zooids are confined to the dorsal surface, which is uppermost
  in the natural position of the colony. The peduncle is short and does not contain an axial
  skeleton. The colour of <span class="pagenum" id="page364"><span
  class="smaller">{364}</span></span>this Sea-pen is usually violet when dried or preserved.
  Specimens of <i>Renilla</i> are very abundant in shallow water in some localities on the Atlantic
  and Pacific coasts of N. America, but the genus has also been obtained from the Red Sea and the
  coast of Australia. A popular name for this genus is "Sea pansy."</p>

  <p><b>Sect. 4. Veretilleae.</b>&mdash;This section contains a number of genera in which the
  bilateral arrangement of the zooids is obscured by their gradual encroachment on the dorsal side
  of the axial polyp. The rachis and peduncle are thick and fleshy, and the autozooids and
  siphonozooids are irregularly distributed all round the rachis. The genus <i>Cavernularia</i> is
  not uncommonly found in moderate depths of water in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, and is
  distinguished from the other genera by the reduction of the skeletal axis. Other genera are
  <i>Veretillum</i>, Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean, and <i>Lituaria</i>, Indian Ocean.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">ANTHOZOA (<i>CONTINUED</i>):
  ZOANTHARIA</span></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Class II. Zoantharia.</b></p>

  <p>The Zoantharia exhibit a great deal more diversity of form and structure than the Alcyonaria.
  The sub-class is consequently difficult to define in a few words, and it may be taken to include
  all the Anthozoa which do not possess the typical Alcyonarian characters.</p>

  <p>All the orders, with the exception of the Antipathidea and Zoanthidea, contain genera of
  solitary zooids, and the orders Edwardsiidea and Cerianthidea contain no genera that form
  colonies. In the Madreporaria, Zoanthidea, and Antipathidea, on the other hand, colonies are
  formed composed of a very large number of individuals which frequently attain to a very great
  size. The term "Sea-anemone" is commonly used in writing about the solitary Zoantharia which do
  not form any skeletal structures, and the term "Coral" is applied to all those Zoantharia which do
  form a skeleton.</p>

  <p>In a scientific treatise, however, these popular terms can no longer be satisfactorily
  employed. The "Sea-anemones" exhibit so many important differences in anatomical structure that
  they must be placed in at least three distinct orders that are not closely related, and the
  organisms to which the term Coral has been applied belong to so many organisms&mdash;such as
  Alcyonaria, Hydrozoa, Polyzoa, and even Algae&mdash;that its use has become indeterminate.</p>

  <p>Whilst these terms must disappear from the systematic part of Zoology, they may still be
  employed, however, in the description of a local fauna or coral reef to signify the soft solitary
  zooids on <span class="pagenum" id="page366"><span class="smaller">{366}</span></span>the one
  hand, and the organisms, animals or plants, which form large, massive skeletons of carbonate of
  lime, on the other.</p>

  <p>The form of the solitary zooids and of the colony of zooids in the Zoantharia, then, may be
  very divergent. In the Actiniaria we find single soft gelatinous zooids of considerable size
  adherent to rocks or half-buried in the sand. Among the Madreporaria we find great branching
  colonies of thousands of zooids supported by the copious skeleton of carbonate of lime that they
  have secreted. Among the Antipathidea, again, we find a dendritic skeleton of a dark horny
  substance, formed by a colony of small zooids that cover it like a thin bark. The majority of the
  Zoantharia are, like other zoophytes, permanently fixed to the floor of the ocean. Where the
  embryo settles, there must the adult or colony of adults remain until death. Some of the common
  Sea-anemones can, however, glide slowly over the surface on which they rest, and thus change their
  position according to the conditions of their surroundings. Others (the Minyadidae) float upside
  down in the sea, and are carried hither and thither by the currents. Others, again
  (<i>Cerianthus</i>, <i>Edwardsia</i>, <i>Peachia</i>), burrow in the sand or mud at the
  sea-bottom.</p>

  <p>The structure of the zooid varies considerably, but in the following characters differs from
  the zooid of the Alcyonaria. The <b>tentacles</b> are usually simple finger-like processes, and
  when they bear secondary pinnae these can readily be distinguished from the rows of secondary
  pinnules of the Alcyonarian tentacle. The number of tentacles is very rarely eight (young
  <i>Halcampa</i>), and in these cases they are not pinnate. The number of tentacles may be six
  (many Antipathidea and some zooids of <i>Madrepora</i>), twelve (<i>Madrepora</i>), some multiple
  of six, or an indefinite number. In the Thalassianthidae and some other families of Actiniaria the
  tentacles are plumose, but do not exhibit the regular pinnate form of the tentacles of
  Alcyonaria.</p>

      <i>A. glomeratum</i>. (After Haddon.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>As regards the number of <b>mesenteries</b>, the Zoantharia exhibit <span class="pagenum"
  id="page367"><span class="smaller">{367}</span></span>very great variety. It has been shown that
  there is frequently a stage in their development during which there are only eight mesenteries.
  This stage is usually called the <i>Edwardsia</i> stage. These eight mesenteries are arranged in
  bilateral pairs as follows:&mdash;One pair is attached to the body-wall and reaches to the dorsal
  side of the stomodaeum, and is called the pair of dorsal directives; a corresponding pair attached
  to the ventral side of the stomodaeum is called the pair of ventral directives. The other two
  pairs are the lateral mesenteries. To these four pairs are added, at the close of the
  <i>Edwardsia</i> stage, two additional pairs, making in all twelve mesenteries (cf. Fig. 163).</p>

  <p>These six primary pairs of mesenteries, conveniently called the "protocnemes" by Duerden, may
  be traced in the development and recognised in the adult of the majority of Zoantharia. But the
  number of the mesenteries is usually increased in the later stages by the addition of other
  mesenteries called the "metacnemes." The metacnemes differ from the protocnemes in that they
  usually appear in unilateral pairs, that is to say, in pairs of which both members arise on the
  same side of the stomodaeum, and the number is very variable throughout the group. The space
  enclosed by a pair of mesenteries is called an "entocoele," and the space between two pairs of
  mesenteries is called an "ectocoele."</p>

  <p>The twelve protocnemes are usually complete mesenteries, that is to say, they extend the whole
  distance from the body-wall to the stomodaeum, while the metacnemes may be complete or incomplete;
  in the latter case extending only a part of the distance from the body-wall towards the
  stomodaeum.</p>

  <p>We find, therefore, in making a general survey of the anatomy of the Zoantharia that there is
  no general statement to be made, concerning the number or arrangement of the mesenteries, which
  holds good for the whole or even for a considerable portion of the genera.</p>

  <p>The bands of retractor muscles are, as in the Alcyonaria, situated on one face only of the
  mesenteries (except in the Antipathidea and Cerianthidea), but an important character of the
  Zoantharia is that the muscle bands on the ventral pair of directives are situated on the dorsal
  faces of these mesenteries, and not on the ventral faces as they are in Alcyonaria.</p>

  <p>In the Edwardsiidea there are only eight complete mesenteries, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page368"><span class="smaller">{368}</span></span>but a variable number of other rudimentary
  and incomplete mesenteries have recently been discovered by Faurot.<a id="NtA_392"
  href="#Nt_392"><sup>[392]</sup></a> In the Zoanthidea the mesenteries are numerous, but the order
  is remarkable for the fact that the dorsal directives are incomplete, and that, of the pairs of
  metacnemes that are added, one mesentery becomes complete and the other remains incomplete. In
  most of the genera of the Antipathidea there are only ten mesenteries, but in <i>Leiopathes</i>
  there are twelve, and as they bear no bands of retractor muscles it is difficult to determine
  accurately their true relation to the mesenteries of other Zoantharia.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 163.</span>&mdash;Diagrams of transverse sections of 1,
      Alcyonarian; 2, <i>Edwardsia</i>; 3, <i>Cerianthus</i>; 4, <i>Zoanthus</i>; 5, <i>Favia</i>;
      6, <i>Madrepora</i>. <i>DD</i>, the dorsal directive mesenteries; <i>VD</i>, the ventral
      directives; <i>I-VI</i>, the protocnemes in order of sequence.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the Cerianthidea the mesenteries are very numerous, and increase in numbers by the addition
  of single mesenteries alternately right and left in the ventral inter-mesenteric chamber
  throughout the life of the individual. These mesenteries do not bear retractor muscles.</p>

  <p>In the Actiniaria and Madreporaria, with the exception of the genera <i>Madrepora</i>,
  <i>Porites</i>, and a few others, there are also very many mesenteries. The two pairs of
  directives are usually present, but they may not occur in those zooids that are produced <span
  class="pagenum" id="page369"><span class="smaller">{369}</span></span>asexually by fission (see p.
  <a href="#page388">388</a>). The metacnemes are frequently formed in regular cycles, and in many
  genera appear to be constantly some multiple of six (Fig. 163, <span
  class="smaller">5</span>).</p>

  <p>In <i>Madrepora</i> and <i>Porites</i><a id="NtA_393" href="#Nt_393"><sup>[393]</sup></a> the
  two pairs of directives and two pairs of lateral protocnemes are complete; the other two pairs of
  protocnemes are, however, incomplete; and metacnemes are not developed (Fig. 163, <span
  class="smaller">6</span>).</p>

  <p>The stomodaeum is usually a flattened tube extending some distance into the coelenteric cavity
  and giving support to the inner edges of the complete mesenteries; in many of the Madreporaria,
  however, it is oval or circular in outline. In most of the Actiniaria there are deep grooves on
  the dorsal and ventral sides of the stomodaeum, but in Zoanthidea the groove occurs on the ventral
  side only and in the Cerianthidea on the dorsal side only. In the Madreporaria these grooves do
  not occur or are relatively inconspicuous.<a id="NtA_394" href="#Nt_394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> In
  the Alcyonaria the siphonoglyph exhibits a very marked differentiation of the epithelium (see Fig.
  148, p. <a href="#page334">334</a>), and the cilia it bears are very long and powerful. It has not
  been shown that the grooves in the Zoantharia show similar modifications of structure, and they
  are called by the writers on Zoantharia the sulci. There is no difference in structure, and rarely
  any difference in size, between the dorsal sulcus and the ventral sulcus in the Actiniaria, and
  the use of the word&mdash;sulculus&mdash;for the former is not to be commended.</p>

  <p>The mesenteries bear upon their free edges the mesenteric filaments. These organs are usually
  more complicated in structure than the corresponding organs of the Alcyonaria, and the dorsal pair
  of filaments is not specialised for respiratory purposes as it is in that group.</p>

  <p>In many genera the mesenteric filaments bear long, thread-like processes&mdash;the
  "acontia"&mdash;armed with gland cells and nematocysts which can be protruded from the mouth or
  pushed through special holes (the "cinclides") in the body-wall.</p>

  <p>The gonads in the Zoantharia are borne upon the sides of the mesenteries and are usually in the
  form of long lobed ridges instead of being spherical in form, and situated at the edges of the
  mesenteries as they are in the Alcyonaria.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page370"><span class="smaller">{370}</span></span></div>

  <p>Nearly all the zooids and even the colonies of the Zoantharia are unisexual, but some species,
  such as <i>Manicina areolata</i> (Wilson), <i>Meandrina labyrinthica</i> (Duerden), <i>Cerianthus
  membranaceus</i>, and others, are hermaphrodite. Mr. J. S. Gardiner has recently given reasons for
  believing that the genus <i>Flabellum</i> is protandrous.</p>

  <p><b>Skeleton.</b>&mdash;The soft tissues of the Zoantharian zooids may be supported or protected
  by hard skeletal structures of various kinds. In the Zoanthidea and the Actiniaria there are many
  species that have no skeletal support at all, and are quite naked. These seem to be sufficiently
  well protected from the attacks of carnivorous animals by the numerous nematocysts of the
  ectoderm, and perhaps in addition by a disagreeable flavour in their tissues. Anemones do not seem
  to be eaten habitually by any fish, but cases have been described of <i>Peachia hastata</i> being
  found in the stomach of the Cod, and of <i>Edwardsia</i> in the stomach of the Flounder.<a
  id="NtA_395" href="#Nt_395"><sup>[395]</sup></a> On the Scottish coasts Anemones are occasionally
  used with success as a bait for cod.<a id="NtA_396" href="#Nt_396"><sup>[396]</sup></a> The
  body-wall of <i>Edwardsia</i>, however, is protected to a certain extent by the secretion of a
  mucous coat in which grains of sand and mud are embedded. Some Anemones, such as <i>Urticina</i>,
  <i>Peachia</i>, and others, lie half-buried in the sand, and others form a cuticle, like that of
  <i>Edwardsia</i>, to which foreign bodies are attached.</p>

  <p><i>Cerianthus</i> is remarkable for constructing a long tube composed of a felt-work of
  discharged nematocysts mixed with mud and mucus, into which it retires for protection. In the
  Zoanthidea the body-wall is frequently strengthened by numerous and relatively large grains of
  sand, which are passed through the ectoderm to lie in the thick mesogloea.</p>

  <p>In the Madreporaria a very elaborate skeleton of carbonate of lime is formed. In the solitary
  forms it consists of a cup-shaped outer covering for the base and column of the zooid called the
  "theca," of a series of radial vertical walls or "septa" projecting into the intermesenteric
  chambers carrying the endodermal lining of the coelenteric cavity with them, and in some cases a
  pillar, the "columella," or a series of smaller pillars, the "pali" projecting upwards from the
  centre of the base of the <span class="pagenum" id="page371"><span
  class="smaller">{371}</span></span>theca towards the stomodaeum. In the colonial forms the theca
  of the individual zooids is continuous with a common colonial skeleton called the "coenosteum."
  This is solid in the Imperforate corals, and it supports at the surface only a thin lamina of
  canals and superficial ectoderm. In the Perforate corals, however, the coenosteum envelopes and
  surrounds the canals during its formation, and thereby remains perforated by a network of fine
  channels. In the colonial Madreporaria the skeletal cups which support and protect the zooids are
  called the "calices."</p>

  <p>The skeleton of the Antipathidea is of a different nature. It is composed of a horny substance
  allied to keratin. When it is old and thick, it usually has a polished black appearance, and is
  commonly termed "black coral." The surface of this kind of coral is ornamented with thorny or
  spiny projections, but it is never perforated by calices or canal systems. It forms a solid axis
  for the branches of the corals, and all the soft parts of the zooids and coenosarc are superficial
  to it.</p>

  <p>It was formerly considered that this type of coral, which shows no trace of the shape and form
  of the living organisms that produce it, is of a different character to the calcareous skeleton
  which exhibits calices, septa, pores, and other evidence of the living organism, and it was called
  a "sclerobase" to distinguish it from the "scleroderm" of the Madreporaria.</p>

  <p>It is now known that both the sclerobasic skeleton and the sclerodermic skeleton are products
  of the ectoderm, and consequently these expressions are no longer in general use.</p>

  <p><b>Asexual reproduction</b> in the Zoantharia may be effected by continuous or discontinuous
  fission or gemmation.</p>

  <p>In the Edwardsiidea, Actiniaria, and Cerianthidea, that is to say in the animals popularly
  known as Sea-anemones, asexual reproduction does not commonly occur, but nevertheless a good many
  instances of it are now known in individual genera. In <i>Actinoloba</i> (<i>Metridium</i>), for
  example, Parker has described a case of complete longitudinal fission, and Duerden states that it
  occurs in the West Indian Anemones <i>Actinotryx</i> and <i>Ricordea</i>. A still more remarkable
  form of asexual reproduction known as transverse fission has been described in the genus
  <i>Gonactinia</i>.<a id="NtA_397" href="#Nt_397"><sup>[397]</sup></a> In this case, the body of
  the Anemone becomes constricted in <span class="pagenum" id="page372"><span
  class="smaller">{372}</span></span>the middle, a circlet of tentacles is formed below the
  constriction, and division takes place. The upper half floats away with the original tentacles and
  stomodaeum and becomes attached by the base in another place; the lower half remains behind and
  develops a new stomodaeum, mesenteric filaments, and sexual organs. In some of the Actiniaria
  another form of asexual reproduction occurs, known as "Pedal laceration." In the common British
  <i>Actinoloba</i>, for example, so often kept in aquaria, the pedal disc sometimes spreads on the
  glass or rock upon which the animal rests, in the form of a thin membrane or film of an irregular
  circular shape, nearly twice the diameter of the column. As the Anemone glides along, the film
  remains behind and breaks up into a number of hemispherical droplets, which in a few days develop
  tentacles, a mouth, mesenteries, and the other organs of a complete and independent Anemone. A
  similar method of reproduction has been observed in several species of <i>Sagartia</i>. A true
  process of discontinuous gemmation has also been observed in <i>Gonactinia</i>, in
  <i>Corynactis</i>, and in <i>Actinoloba</i>.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 164.</span>&mdash;Longitudinal fission of
      <i>Actinoloba</i>. (After Agassiz and Parker.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the Madreporaria, Zoanthidea and Antipathidea, the usual method of reproduction to form the
  colonies is continuous gemmation. The new zooids that are added to the colony as it grows arise as
  buds, either from the superficial canals of the coenenchym, or from the base or body-wall of the
  older zooids. In these cases the young zooids acquire the same number of mesenteries, and the same
  characters of the stomodaeum as the original parent. Some further particulars of asexual
  reproduction in the Madreporaria are given on p. <a href="#page387">387</a>.</p>

  <p>The <b>sexual reproduction</b> of a great many species of Zoantharia has now been observed. The
  eggs are, as a general rule, ripened in batches, and fertilisation is effected before their
  discharge from the body. In some cases the sexual condition is seasonal. In temperate climates the
  generative organs ripen in the spring and <span class="pagenum" id="page373"><span
  class="smaller">{373}</span></span>summer months, and remain small and relatively inconspicuous in
  the colder weather; but British Sea-anemones, when kept in an aquarium and regularly fed, will
  breed nearly all the year round. The corals of the tropics living in warmer water of a more
  regular temperature show considerable variety in their breeding habits. Thus Duerden found that
  colonies of <i>Favia</i>, <i>Manicina</i>, <i>Siderastraea</i> and <i>Porites</i> are fertile at
  nearly all times, whereas colonies of <i>Madrepora</i>, <i>Orbicella</i> and <i>Cladocora</i> were
  rarely so. In nearly all cases the fertilisation is effected, and segmentation of the ovum occurs
  within the body of the parent, the young Zoantharian beginning its independent life as an oval or
  pear-shaped ciliated larva.</p>

  <p>There are a great many cases among the Actiniaria in which the embryos are retained within the
  coelenteron, or in special brood pouches of the parent (p. <a href="#page379">379</a>), until a
  stage is reached with twelve or more tentacles.</p>

  <p>The oval or pear-shaped larva swims about for a few days or hours, and then settles down on its
  aboral end. In swimming, the aboral end is always turned forwards. In the larva of <i>Lebrunia
  coralligens</i> and <i>Rhodactis sancti-thomae</i>, a distinct sense organ has been observed upon
  the aboral extremity, and a similar but less distinct organ on the larva of <i>Actinia equina</i>.
  These organs are of considerable interest, as they are probably the only specialised sense organs
  known to occur in the Zoantharia.</p>

  <p>The larvae of Zoantharia present, as a rule, very little variation from the type described, and
  live but a short time if they fail to find a suitable place for fixation. The colour is usually
  white and opaque, but in some species the endoderm may be coloured yellow by Zooxanthellae (cf.
  pp. <a href="#page86">86</a>, <a href="#page125">125</a>).</p>

  <p>The larvae of the Cerianthidea, however, are remarkable and exceptional. After the larva of
  these animals has passed through the gastrula stage, a certain number of mesenteries and tentacles
  are formed, and it rises in the water to live a pelagic life of some duration. This larva is known
  as <i>Arachnactis</i>, and is not unfrequently found in the plankton.</p>

  <p>The character of the <b>food</b> of the Zoantharia varies with the size of the zooids, the
  occurrence of Zooxanthellae in the endoderm, and local circumstances; but in general it may be
  said to consist mainly of small living animals.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page374"><span class="smaller">{374}</span></span></div>

  <p>Sea-anemones kept in an aquarium will readily seize and devour pieces of raw beef or fragments
  of mussel that are offered to them; but they may also be observed to kill and swallow the small
  Crustacea that occur in the water. When a living animal of a relatively small size comes within
  range of the tentacles, it appears to be suddenly paralysed by the action of the nematocysts and
  held fast. The tentacles in contact with it, and others in the neighbourhood but to a lesser
  extent, then bend inwards, carrying the prey to the mouth. The passage of the food through the
  stomodaeum is effected partly by ciliary, and partly by muscular action, and the food is then
  brought to the region of the mesenteric filaments where it is rapidly disintegrated by the
  digestive fluids they secrete. Any unsavoury or undigested portions of the food are ejected by the
  mouth.</p>

  <p>Very little is known concerning the food of the Madreporarian Corals. Many investigators have
  noticed that the zooids of preserved specimens very rarely contain any fragments of animal or
  plant bodies that could possibly be regarded as evidence of food. It is possible that many Corals
  derive a part, perhaps in some cases a considerable part, of their nourishment from the symbiotic
  Zooxanthellae (pp. <a href="#page86">86</a>, <a href="#page125">125</a>) which flourish in the
  endoderm; but it is improbable that in any case this forms the only source of food supply. The
  absence of food material in the cavities of the zooids may perhaps be accounted for by the fact
  that nearly all the Corals are fully expanded, and therefore capable of catching their food only
  at night. Corals are usually collected during the daytime, and therefore during the period of rest
  of the digestive organs.</p>

  <p>It is true that nearly all Corals do exhibit Zooxanthellae in their endoderm, but there are
  some species from which they are nearly or wholly absent, such as <i>Astrangia solitaria</i> and
  <i>Phyllangia americana</i> on the West Indian reefs,<a id="NtA_398"
  href="#Nt_398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> and the Pocilloporidae. The absence of any signs of
  degeneration in the tentacles or digestive organs of those corals with Zooxanthellae as compared
  with those without them suggests, at any rate, that the Zooxanthellae do not supply such a large
  proportion of the food necessary for the support of the colonies as to warrant any relaxation of
  the efforts to obtain food by other means. Mr. Duerden found that when living Annelids are placed
  upon the <span class="pagenum" id="page375"><span class="smaller">{375}</span></span>tentacles of
  a living <i>Siderastraea</i>&mdash;a genus with Zooxanthellae, the tentacles at once close upon
  them and prevent their escape. The general conclusion seems to be, therefore, that the
  Madreporarian Corals feed upon small animals in much the same way as the Sea-anemones, whether
  they have Zooxanthellae or not, but that in general they feed only at night.</p>

  <p><b>Age.</b>&mdash;It is known that Sea-anemones kept in an aquarium and regularly fed will live
  for a considerable number of years without showing signs of weakness or failing health. Dalyell
  kept in an aquarium a specimen of <i>Actinia mesembryanthemum</i>, which lived for sixty-six years
  and then died a natural death; and specimens of <i>Sagartia</i>, still living, are known to be
  about fifty years old.<a id="NtA_399" href="#Nt_399"><sup>[399]</sup></a> The unnatural conditions
  of life in an aquarium may have favoured the longevity of these specimens, and it would not be
  reasonable to conclude from these records that the average life of a full-grown Anemone on the
  rocks is more than thirty or thirty-five years, and perhaps it is a good deal less.</p>

  <p class="sp3">As regards the Madreporarian Corals, we know but little concerning their duration
  of life. An examination of any living coral reef is sufficient to convince an observer that the
  power of asexual reproduction of the colonial forms is not unlimited; that colonies, like
  individuals, have a definite span of life, and that they grow old, senile, and then die a natural
  death if spared in their youth from accident and disease. Mr. Gardiner has calculated that the
  duration of life in solitary Corals like <i>Flabellum</i> is about twenty-four years, in colonial
  forms such as <i>Goniastraea</i>, <i>Prionastraea</i>, <i>Orbicella</i>, and <i>Pocillopora</i>,
  from twenty-two to twenty-eight years.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Edwardsiidea.</b></p>

  <p>This order contains only a few genera and species of small size living in shallow water in
  various parts of the world. In external features they closely resemble several genera of the
  Actiniaria, particularly those belonging to the family Halcampidae. The distinguishing character
  of the order is to be found in the system of mesenteries. In all the species only eight
  mesenteries are complete, namely, the first two pairs of protocnemes, and the two pairs of
  directives (Fig. 163, <span class="smaller">2</span>), <span class="pagenum" id="page376"><span
  class="smaller">{376}</span></span>and these usually support such large and powerful muscle-bands
  that they appear to be the only mesenteries present. A careful examination of transverse sections,
  however, reveals the fact that other mesenteries are present. The fifth and sixth pairs of
  protocnemes seem to be invariably represented, and two or three pairs of metacnemes can also be
  traced in some species.</p>

  <p>The tentacles are variable in number. In <i>Edwardsia beautempsii</i>, for example, they may be
  14-16 in number, arranged in a single row round the oral disc. In <i>E. timida</i> they vary from
  20 to 24. The normal number appears to be eight tentacles of the first cycle, corresponding to the
  eight primary inter-mesenteric chambers, <i>plus</i> 6 or 12 tentacles, corresponding with the
  chambers limited by the more rudimentary mesenteries,&mdash;making a total of 14 or 20 tentacles;
  but by the suppression of the two primary dorso-lateral tentacles, or by the addition of tentacles
  of another cycle, the actual number is found to vary considerably.   The Edwardsiidea are not
  fixed to the bottom, but are usually found deeply embedded in sand, the aboral extremity being
  pointed and used for burrowing purposes. The general colour of the body is yellow or yellowish
  brown, but it is partly hidden by a short jacket of mud or sand and mucous secretion. The oral
  crown frequently shows beautiful colours. De Quatrefages relates that in <i>Edwardsia
  beautempsii</i> the oral cone is golden yellow, and the tentacles, transparent for the greater
  part of their extent, terminate in opaque points of a beautiful yellowish red colour.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Edwardsiidae.</b>&mdash;Several species of this family have been found in the
  British area. They are very local in their distribution, but sometimes occur in great numbers.</p>

  <p><i>Edwardsia beautempsii</i> occurs in shallow water near the shores of the English Channel and
  has been found in Bantry Bay; and <i>E. carnea</i> and <i>E. timida</i> have also been found in
  the Channel. <i>E. tecta</i> is a recently described species from the S. Irish coast, and <i>E.
  allmani</i> and <i>E. goodsiri</i> are found in Scottish waters.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Protantheidae.</b>&mdash;This family, constituted for the reception of three
  remarkable genera, is now usually included in the order Edwardsiidea on the ground that not more
  than eight mesenteries are complete.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The genus <i>Gonactinia</i> exhibits the very exceptional character of having a
  thick layer of muscles in the body-wall (cf. Cerianthidea, p. <a href="#page409">409</a>), and it
  is also remarkable for the frequency with which it reproduces itself asexually by longitudinal
  and, more rarely, by transverse fission. It has been found in Norway, the Mediterranean, and on
  the reefs of New Caledonia. The other genera of the family are <i>Oractis</i> from California, and
  <i>Protanthea</i> from the coast of Sweden.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Actiniaria.</b></p>

  <p>This order contains nearly all the animals popularly known as Sea-anemones. They are usually
  found in shallow water, attached by a broad basal disc to shells, stones, or sea-weeds. In the
  Halcampidae, however, the aboral extremity ends in a blunt point as in the Cerianthidea and
  Edwardsiidea, and the animals live half-buried in sand or mud. The Minyadidae of the southern
  oceans are pelagic in habit, floating near the surface of the sea with the mouth turned downwards.
  They are supported in the water by a bladder, formed by an involution of the pedal disc, and
  filled with gas.</p>

  <p>Many of the Sea-anemones are found in symbiotic association with other animals. The common
  <i>Adamsia</i> of the British coasts is found on whelk shells containing hermit crabs. The crab is
  probably protected from the attacks of some of its enemies by the presence of the Anemone, which
  in its turn has the advantage of securing some fragments of the food captured and torn to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page378"><span class="smaller">{378}</span></span>pieces by the crab. The
  association, therefore, seems to be one of mutual advantage to the messmates. It is a noteworthy
  fact that in these associations the species of Sea-anemone associated with a particular hermit
  crab is nearly always constant. Thus in the English Channel, <i>Adamsia palliata</i> is almost
  invariably found associated with <i>Eupagurus prideauxii</i>, and <i>Adamsia rondeletii</i> with
  <i>Eupagurus bernhardus</i>. But, perhaps, the most remarkable association of this kind is to be
  seen in the case of the little shore crab of the Indian Ocean, <i>Melia tesselata</i>, which
  invariably holds in each of its large claws a small Sea-anemone. M&ouml;bius, who originally described
  this case, relates that when the crab is robbed of its Anemone it appears to be greatly agitated,
  and hunts about on the sand in the endeavour to find it again, and will even collect the pieces,
  if the Anemone is cut up, and arrange them in its claw.<a id="NtA_400"
  href="#Nt_400"><sup>[400]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Another very interesting association is that of certain fish and Crustacea with the large
  Sea-anemones of the tropical Australian coast.<a id="NtA_401" href="#Nt_401"><sup>[401]</sup></a>
  Thus <i>Stoichactis kenti</i> almost invariably contains two or more specimens of the Percoid fish
  <i>Amphiprion percula</i>. This fish is remarkable for its brilliant colour, three pearly white
  cross-bands interrupt a ground plan of bright orange-vermilion, and the ends of the cross-bands as
  well as the fins are bordered with black. In another species a prawn of similar striking colours
  is found. These companions of the giant Anemones swim about among the tentacles unharmed, and when
  disturbed seek refuge in the mouth. It has been suggested that these bright and attractive animals
  serve as a lure or bait for other animals, which are enticed into striking distance of the
  stinging threads of the Anemone, but how the commensals escape the fate of the animals they
  attract has yet to be explained.</p>

  <p>In a considerable number of Sea-anemones, such as <i>Actinoloba marginata</i> and <i>A.
  dianthus</i>, some species of <i>Sagartia</i>, <i>Actinia cari</i>, <i>Anemonia sulcata</i>, and
  <i>Calliactis parasitica</i>, the fertilisation of the eggs and their subsequent development take
  place in the sea water.<a id="NtA_402" href="#Nt_402"><sup>[402]</sup></a> In a great many others,
  such as <i>Bunodes</i> (several species), <i>Cereactis aurantiaca</i>, <i>Sagartia
  troglodytes</i>, <i>Bunodactis <span class="pagenum" id="page379"><span
  class="smaller">{379}</span></span>gemmacea</i>, etc., the embryos are discharged into the water
  from the body-cavity of the parent, at a stage with six or twelve tentacles. In the Arctic species
  of the genera <i>Urticina</i> and <i>Actinostola</i>, however, the embryos are retained within the
  body of the parent until several cycles of tentacles are developed, and in <i>Urticina
  crassicornis</i> the young have been found with the full number of tentacles already formed. In
  <i>Epiactis prolifera</i> from Puget Sound, the young Anemones attach themselves to the body-wall
  of the parent after their discharge, and in <i>Epiactis marsupialis</i>, <i>Pseudophellia
  arctica</i>, <i>Epigonactis fecunda</i>, and other species from cold waters, the young are found
  in numerous brood sacs opening in rows on the body-wall. It is not known for certain how these
  embryos enter the brood sacs, but it is possible that each sac is formed independently for a young
  embryo that has settled down from the outside upon the body-wall of the parent. The most
  specialised example of this kind of parental care in the Sea-anemones is seen in <i>Marsupifer
  valdiviae</i> from Kerguelen, in which there are only six brood sacs, but each one contains a
  great many (50-100) embryos.</p>

  <p>The wonderful colours of our British Sea-anemones are familiar to most persons who have visited
  the sea-side. The common <i>Actinia mesembryanthemum</i> of rock pools, for example, is of a
  purple red colour. The base is usually green with an azure line. Around the margin of the disc
  there are some twenty-five turquoise blue tubercles. On each side of the mouth there is a small
  purple spot, and the numerous tentacles forming a circlet round the mouth are of a pale roseate
  colour. Nothing could be more beautiful than the snowy-white <i>Actinoloba dianthus</i> or the
  variegated <i>Urticina crassicornis</i>.</p>

  <p>Similar wonderful variety and beauty of colour are seen in the Sea-anemones of other parts of
  the world. Thus Saville Kent<a id="NtA_403" href="#Nt_403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> in describing a
  species of the gigantic <i>Stoichactis</i> of the Australian Barrier Reef says, "the spheroidal
  bead-like tentacles occur in irregularly mixed patches of grey, white, lilac, and emerald green,
  the disc being shaded with tints of grey, while the oral orifice is bordered with bright
  yellow."</p>

  <p>The order Actiniaria contains a large number of families, presenting a great variety of
  external form and of detail in general anatomy. The definitions of the families and their <span
  class="pagenum" id="page380"><span class="smaller">{380}</span></span>arrangement in larger groups
  have presented many difficulties, and have led to considerable differences of opinion; and even
  now, although our anatomical knowledge has been greatly extended, the classification cannot be
  regarded as resting on a very firm basis. The families may be grouped into two sub-orders<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sub-Order 1. Actiniina.</span>&mdash;The tentacles are simple and similar, and
  there is one tentacle corresponding to each intermesenteric chamber (endocoel).</p>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">Sub-Order 2. Stichodactylina.</span>&mdash;The tentacles are
  simple and similar, or provided with teat-like or ramified pinnules. One or more tentacles may
  correspond with an endocoel, and there may be two kinds of tentacles (marginal and accessory) in
  the same genus.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order 1. Actiniina.</b></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Halcampidae.</b>&mdash;This family is clearly most closely related to the
  Edwardsiidea. There are, however, twelve complete mesenteries of the first cycle, and a second
  cycle of more or less incomplete mesenteries. The tentacles are usually twelve in number, but may
  be twenty or twenty-four. There is no pedal disc, but the base is swollen and rounded or pointed
  at the end.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Halcampa</i> includes a considerable number of small species occurring in the
  shallow waters of the temperate northern hemisphere, and of the Kerguelen Islands in the south.
  Three British species have been described, of which <i>Halcampa chrysanthellum</i> alone is
  common. The larva with eight tentacles and eight mesenteries has been found living on the Medusa
  <i>Thaumantias</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Peachia</i> is a genus containing Anemones of much larger size (10-25 cm.). It is remarkable
  for the very large siphonoglyph on the ventral side of the stomodaeum, prolonged into a papillate
  lip projecting from the mouth called the "conchula." The genera <i>Scytophorus</i> from 150
  fathoms off Kerguelen and <i>Gyractis</i> from Ceylon, although showing some remarkable
  peculiarities of their mesenteric system, appear to be closely related to this family.</p>

  <p><i>Ilyanthus mitchellii</i> is a large Anemone with a vesicular base, forty-eight tentacles and
  mesenteries, occurring in the English Channel, but it is not very common. It is usually <span
  class="pagenum" id="page381"><span class="smaller">{381}</span></span>placed in a separate family,
  but is in many respects intermediate in character between the Halcampidae and the Actiniidae.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Actiniidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains some of the commonest British
  Sea-anemones. There is a large flat pedal disc by which the body is attached to stones and rocks.
  The body-wall is usually smooth, and not perforated by cinclides. The edge of the disc is usually
  provided with coloured marginal tubercles. There are no acontia.</p>

  <p><i>Actinia.</i>&mdash;This genus contains the widely distributed and very variable species
  <i>Actinia mesembryanthemum</i>, one of the commonest of the Sea-anemones found in rock pools on
  the British coast. The colours of this species are often very beautiful (see p. <a
  href="#page379">379</a>) but variable.</p>

  <p><i>Anemonia</i> is a genus with remarkably long tentacles which are not completely retractile.
  <i>A. sulcata</i> (sometimes called <i>Anthea cereus</i>) is very common in the rock pools of our
  southern coasts.</p>

  <p><i>Bolocera tuediae</i> is, next to <i>Actinoloba dianthus</i>, the largest of the British
  Anemones. It has very much the same colour as the common varieties of <i>Actinia
  mesembryanthemum</i>, but the body-wall is studded with minute, rounded warts. It is found between
  tide marks in the Clyde sea-area, but usually occurs in deeper water.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Sagartiidae.</b>&mdash;This family includes several genera with a contractile pedal
  disc, with the body-wall usually perforated by cinclides, and provided with acontia.</p>

  <p>The genera may be arranged in several sub-families distinguished by well-marked characters.
  Among the well-known Sea-anemones included in the family may be mentioned<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><i>Sagartia troglodytes</i>, a very common British species found in hollows in rocks. It is
  usually of an olive green or olive brown colour, and the upper third or two-thirds of the
  body-wall is beset with numerous pale suckers. <i>Adamsia palliata</i> has a white body-wall
  spotted with bright red patches, and is associated with the hermit crab <i>Eupagurus
  prideauxii</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Actinoloba</i> (frequently called <i>Metridium</i>) <i>dianthus</i> is considered the
  handsomest of all the British Sea-anemones. It has a lobed disc frilled with numerous small
  tentacles, and is uniformly coloured, creamy-white, yellow, pale pink, or olive brown. It lives
  well in captivity, and sometimes reaches a length of 6 inches with a diameter of 3 inches (Fig.
  164).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page382"><span class="smaller">{382}</span></span></div>

  <p><i>Aiptasia couchii</i> is a trumpet-shaped Anemone, found under stones at low-water mark in
  Cornwall and the Channel Islands, with relatively slight power of retraction.</p>

  <p><i>Gephyra dohrnii</i> is an interesting species with twelve tentacles, which was supposed at
  one time to form a connecting link between the Actiniaria and the Antipathidea. It is found
  attached to the stems and branches of various Hydrozoa and Alcyonaria, sometimes in such numbers
  and so closely set that it gives the impression of having formed the substance of its support.
  Haddon<a id="NtA_404" href="#Nt_404"><sup>[404]</sup></a> has described specimens found on the
  stems of <i>Tubularia</i> from deep water off the south and south-west coasts of Ireland. It also
  occurs in the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Aliciidae.</b>&mdash;The members of this family have a large flat contractile base
  and simple tentacles. The body-wall is provided with numerous simple or compound outgrowths or
  vesicles, usually arranged in vertical rows. <i>Alicia mirabilis</i> is a rare Anemone from
  Madeira with a very broad base, capable of changing its position with considerable activity, and
  of becoming free and floating upside down at the surface of the sea. Other genera of the family
  are <i>Bunodeopsis</i> and <i>Cystiactis</i>. The genus <i>Thaumactis</i>, described by Fowler,<a
  id="NtA_405" href="#Nt_405"><sup>[405]</sup></a> from the Papeete reefs, has many peculiarities,
  but is probably capable of crawling rapidly and of floating at the surface like other members of
  the family. The remarkable Anemone <i>Lebrunia</i> from the West Indies may be included in this
  family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Phyllactidae.</b>&mdash;These are distinguished by the presence of a broad collar of
  foliaceous or digitate processes outside the circle of tentacles. The processes have some
  resemblance to the foliaceous tentacles of the Stichodactylinae. They are found in the
  Mediterranean, Red Sea, and on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, but have not yet been found in
  the British area.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Bunodidae.</b>&mdash;This family is characterised by prominent verrucae and
  tubercles of the body-wall. It contains several British species, of which <i>Bunodes gemmacea</i>
  found between tide marks on our southern shores is fairly common. The very common British species
  <i>Urticina</i> (<i>Tealia</i>) <i>crassicornis</i> is usually placed in this family, but exhibits
  some peculiarities which seem <span class="pagenum" id="page383"><span
  class="smaller">{383}</span></span>to warrant its removal to another division of the Actiniaria.
  It is found in tide pools attached to rocks, but is usually partially hidden by adherent sand or
  small stones.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 7. Minyadidae.</b>&mdash;This family contains a number of floating
  Anemones. The basal disc is folded over to form a gas bladder lined by a cuticular secretion. The
  species are principally found in the seas of the southern hemisphere.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order 2. Stichodactylina.</b></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Corallimorphidae.</b>&mdash;In this family the marginal cycle of tentacles and
  accessory tentacles are all of the same kind. The accessory tentacles are arranged in radial rows.
  All the tentacles are knobbed at the extremity. The musculature is weak. <i>Capnea sanguinea</i>,
  <i>Corynactis viridis</i>, and <i>Aureliania heterocera</i> belong to the British fauna. They are
  all small Anemones of exquisite colours, but are not very common. The genus <i>Corallimorphus</i>
  is principally found in the southern hemisphere.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Discosomatidae.</b>&mdash;The tentacles are all of one kind and are very numerous.
  The mesenteries are also very numerous. The sphincter muscle is strong.</p>

  <p>This family includes a rather heterogeneous assembly of forms, and will probably require some
  rearrangement as our knowledge increases. Nearly all the species are found in the shallow waters
  of the tropics, and among them are to be found some of the largest Anemones of the world.
  <i>Stoichactis kenti</i>, from the Barrier Reef, is from one to four feet in diameter across the
  disc. In the West Indies these Anemones do not attain to such a great size, but <i>Homostichanthus
  anemone</i> from Jamaica is sometimes 8 inches in diameter.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Rhodactidae.</b>&mdash;In this family the body-wall is smooth and the oral disc
  greatly expanded. The tentacles are of two kinds. On the margin there is a single cycle of minute
  tentacles, while on the disc there are numerous tuberculate or lobed tentacles. Many of the
  species of this family are quite small, but <i>Actinotryx mussoides</i> from Thursday Island has
  an oral disc 8 inches in diameter. The genera and species are widely distributed in the warm,
  shallow waters of the world.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Thalassianthidae.</b>&mdash;The tentacles are simple or <span class="pagenum"
  id="page384"><span class="smaller">{384}</span></span>ramified (Fig. 166), and in some cases very
  long (<i>Actinodendron arboreum</i>). Many of the specimens of <i>A. plumosum</i> and
  <i>Megalactis griffithsi</i> are of very large size, 8 to 12 inches in diameter. Of the former of
  these two species Saville Kent remarks: "The colours are lacking in brilliancy, being chiefly
  represented by varying shades of light brown and white, which are probably conducive to its
  advantage by assimilating it to the tint of its sandy bed. When fully extended the compound
  tentacles are elevated to a height of 8 or 10 inches, and bear a remarkable resemblance to certain
  of the delicately branching, light brown sea-weeds that abound in its vicinity." The same author
  calls attention to their stinging, which is "nearly as powerful as the ordinary stinging
  nettle."</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order III. Madreporaria.</b></p>

  <p>The Madreporaria form a heterogeneous group of Zoantharia characterised by a single common
  feature, the formation of an extensive skeletal support of carbonate of lime. In a great many
  cases the skeleton exhibits cups or "calices" into which the zooids may be completely or partially
  retracted, and these calices usually exhibit a series of radially disposed vertical laminae, the
  "septa," corresponding with the inter-mesenteric spaces of the zooids. Calices and structures
  simulating septa also occur in <i>Heliopora</i>, which is an Alcyonarian, and in certain fossil
  corals which are probably not Zoantharians. The anatomy of the zooids of a great many Madreporaria
  is now known, and, <span class="pagenum" id="page385"><span
  class="smaller">{385}</span></span>although a great deal of work yet remains to be done, it may be
  said that the Madreporaria exhibit close affinities in structure with the Actiniaria. The chief
  points in the anatomy of the zooids are described under the different sub-divisions, but a few
  words are necessary in this section to explain the principal features exhibited by the
  skeleton.</p>

  <p>There is no more difficult task than the attempt to explain upon any one simple plan the
  various peculiarities of the Madreporarian skeleton.<a id="NtA_406"
  href="#Nt_406"><sup>[406]</sup></a> The authorities upon the group are not agreed upon the use of
  the terms employed, nor are the current theories of the evolution of the skeleton consistent. It
  is necessary, however, to explain the sense in which certain terms are employed in the systematic
  part that follows, and in doing so to indicate a possible line of evolution of the more
  complicated compound skeletons from the simple ones.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 167.</span>&mdash;Series of diagrams to illustrate the
      structure of the Madreporarian skeleton. <b>A</b>, young stage of a solitary coral with simple

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There can be no doubt whatever that the whole of the skeleton of these animals is formed by the
  ectoderm, and is external to their bodies. If we could get rid of the influence of tradition upon
  our use of popular expressions we should call this skeleton a shell. There can be little doubt,
  moreover, that this skeleton is formed by a single layer of specialised ectoderm cells called the
  "calicoblasts."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page386"><span class="smaller">{386}</span></span></div>

  <p>The calicoblasts form, in the first instance, a skeletal plate at the aboral end of the coral
  embryo, which becomes turned up at the edges to form a shallow saucer or cup. This cup is called
  the "prototheca."<a id="NtA_407" href="#Nt_407"><sup>[407]</sup></a> At this stage the body-wall
  of the living zooid may or may not overflow the edge of the prototheca. In the former case the
  growth of the rim of the prototheca is brought about by the calicoblasts of an inner and outer
  layer of epiblast, and the cup is then called the "theca." In the latter case, the growth of the
  rim of the prototheca is continued by the calicoblasts of one layer of epiblast only, and it is
  called the "epitheca" (<i>Flabellum</i>). With the continued growth of the theca the tissues that
  have overflowed&mdash;the "episarc"&mdash;retreat from the base, and in doing so the ectoderm of
  the edge and, to some extent, the outer side of the episarc secrete a layer of epitheca which
  becomes more or less adherent to the theca. Thus the cup may have a double wall, the theca and the
  epitheca (<i>Caryophyllia</i>).</p>

      shows a septum projecting radially from the wall of the theca. (After G. von Koch.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>With the growth of the theca and epitheca a certain number of radially disposed laminae of lime
  rise from the walls and grow centripetally. These are the "septa." Additional ridges on <span
  class="pagenum" id="page387"><span class="smaller">{387}</span></span>the inner wall of the cup
  between the septa are called the "dissepiments." Corresponding with the septa there may be a
  circle of columns or bands rising from the basal parts of the prototheca&mdash;the "pali"; and
  from the actual centre a single column called the "columella." The longitudinal ridges on the
  outside of the theca, corresponding in position with the septa inside, are called the "costae"
  (Fig. 167, E, <i>c</i>).</p>

  <p>We may imagine that in the primitive forms that gave rise to colonies, the episarc of the
  primary zooid overflowed on to the substance to which it was attached, and gave rise to successive
  layers of epithecal skeleton, which may be called the "coenosteum." The ectoderm at the base of
  the original prototheca is in some corals periodically dragged away from the skeleton, and forms
  another cup or platform of lime at a little distance from it&mdash;the "tabula." New zooids are
  developed at some distance from the primary one by a process of gemmation in the episarc, and
  independent thecae, septa, etc., are formed in it; the skeleton of the new zooid thus originated
  being connected with that of the primary zooid by the coenosteum.</p>

  <p>There are many modifications of this simple description of skeleton formation to be considered
  before a thorough knowledge of coral structure can be understood, but sufficient has been said to
  explain the use of the terms that it is necessary to employ in the description of the families.
  When it is necessary to speak of the cup in which the zooid is situated without expressing an
  opinion as to the homology of its wall, it is called the calyx.</p>

  <p>There are many forms of asexual reproduction observed in the Madreporaria. Of these the most
  frequent is gemmation. The buds are formed either on the episarc or on the canals running between
  zooids at the surface of the coenenchym. When the young zooids that have been formed by gemmation
  reach maturity they have the same characters as their parents. Fission occurs in the production of
  a great many colonies of Madreporaria. It occurs occasionally in such genera as <i>Madrepora</i>
  and <i>Porites</i>, where reproduction by gemmation prevails, but it is said that gemmation never
  occurs in those forms such as the Astraeidae Fissiparantes where fission is the rule. In fission a
  division of the zooid takes place in a vertical plane passing through the stomodaeum and dividing
  the zooid into two equal parts. In some cases these two parts become separated during the further
  <span class="pagenum" id="page388"><span class="smaller">{388}</span></span>growth of the coral.
  In other cases, however, further divisions of the stomodaeum occur before the separation of the
  zooids, and then elongated, serpentine polyps are produced (as in <i>Meandrina</i>, etc.), which
  consist of a number of imperfectly separated zooids, each with a distinct mouth and stomodaeum but
  with continuous coelenteric cavities. Two kinds of fission must be distinguished from each other.
  In <i>Madrepora</i> and <i>Porites</i> the plane of fission passes dorso-ventrally through the
  zooids, that is, between the dorsal and ventral pairs of directive mesenteries. In these cases the
  zooids produced by fission are similar to the parent form. In most Madreporaria, however, the
  plane of fission appears to be more or less at right angles to this, and the resulting zooids are
  unlike the original parent form in having either no directive mesenteries at all or only one pair
  of them.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The section Fungacea presents us with some exceptional and remarkable forms of asexual
  reproduction. The embryo <i>Fungia</i> gives rise to a conical fixed coral called a "trophozooid."
  The upper part of the calyx of this trophozooid expands and becomes disc-shaped. This is called
  the "anthocyathus," and after it has reached a certain size it breaks away from the rest of the
  trophozooid as an adult <i>Fungia</i>. Several anthocyathi may be formed in succession from one
  trophozooid. This may be described as a process of successive transverse fission. In
  <i>Diaseris</i> the disc divides into four quadrants, and each quadrant appears to be capable of
  acquiring the shape and size of the undivided parent.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page389"><span class="smaller">{389}</span></span></div>

  <p>Without doubt a process of sexual reproduction occurs in all Madreporaria. In some genera
  sexual reproduction appears to be almost continuous throughout the year; in others the sexual
  organs are formed only at periods separated by considerable intervals of sterility. According to
  the researches of Duerden the Madreporaria appear to be usually viviparous, the early stages of
  development are passed through within the body of the parent, and the young coral is discharged
  into the water as a free-swimming ciliated larva. The larvae are spheroidal, oval, or pear-shaped,
  but change their shape a good deal, and sometimes become elongated, straight, or spirally twisted
  rods. The larvae are at first dense and opaque, but subsequently they become distended by the
  absorption of water, and more nearly transparent. They swim about for one or two days, and then
  settle down by the aboral pole and become fixed. The tentacles are not formed, in any species that
  has yet been observed, during the free-swimming stage of existence.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution of Reef Corals.</b>&mdash;The principal reef-forming corals reach their
  greatest size and grow with greatest rapidity in the warm, shallow waters of the world, but they
  are not confined to this habitat. A species of <i>Madrepora</i> has been found in the very cold
  waters of Archangel, and <i>Manicina areolata</i> occurs in Simon's Bay, Cape of Good Hope, many
  degrees south of the region of the East African coral reefs. As regards the distribution of these
  corals in depth, very little is known at present. The face of the growing coral reef that is
  turned towards the open sea is so steep that it has been found impossible to determine to what
  depth the living reef corals actually extend.</p>

  <p>The survey of the Macclesfield bank proved that a considerable number of reef corals are to be
  found alive at depths <span class="pagenum" id="page390"><span
  class="smaller">{390}</span></span>ranging from 30 to 50 fathoms.<a id="NtA_408"

  <p><b>Coral Reefs and Atolls.</b>&mdash;In many regions of the tropical seas, banks and islands
  are found which are built up of blocks of coral, coral detritus, and altered or modified
  limestone. These are the famous coral reefs of which so much has been said and written during the
  last half-century. There can be little doubt that the superficial strata of these formations are
  entirely due to the action of coral-forming animals and plants living in warm, shallow
  sea-water.</p>

  <p>Three classes of coral reefs are usually recognised: the "fringing reefs" which follow the
  contour of the coast at a distance of a few hundred yards, and are separated from the beach at low
  tide by sand flats or a shallow lagoon; the "barrier reefs," following the contour of the coast
  less regularly than the fringing reefs, but at a much greater distance, and separated from the
  beach by a lagoon of sufficient depth to serve as a harbour for ships of great size; and, finally,
  the "atolls," which are ring-shaped, or broken circlets of low islands enclosing a lagoon which
  is, in some cases, of considerable depth.</p>

  <p>It was observed by the early surveyors that in many cases the sea-bottom slopes downwards
  steeply or almost precipitously from the outer edge of the barrier reefs and atolls to very great
  <span class="pagenum" id="page391"><span class="smaller">{391}</span></span>depths&mdash;to
  depths, in fact, at which reef-forming corals do not live.</p>

  <p>It seems obvious, therefore, that the atolls and barrier-reefs are resting upon some stratum
  which could not possibly have been formed by reef-building organisms at the same relative position
  it has now, and the questions arose, What is the substratum and how was it formed?</p>

  <p>If this stratum is a coral rock, it is clear that it must have been formed at a time when it
  was nearer to the surface of the sea than it is now, and that it must have subsided subsequently
  to greater depths. If, on the other hand, it is a primitive rock, we must assume that in such
  regions as the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific, where the archipelagoes of atolls extend for
  hundreds of miles, there are chains of mountain ranges with peaks reaching to a uniform level
  beneath the surface of the sea. "But we cannot believe that a broad mountain summit lies buried at
  the depth of a few fathoms beneath every atoll, and nevertheless that throughout the immense areas
  above named not one point of rock projects above the level of the sea. For we may judge of
  mountains beneath the sea by those on land, and where can we find a single chain, much less
  several such chains many hundred miles in length, and of considerable breadth, with broad summits
  attaining the same height from within 120 to 180 feet?"<a id="NtA_409"
  href="#Nt_409"><sup>[409]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To account for the observed facts of the atolls and barrier-reefs, Darwin conceived and
  expounded the subsidence theory. According to this theory, the regions where atolls now occur were
  at one time dry land, or an archipelago of volcanic islands surrounded by fringing reefs of the
  ordinary type. A gradual subsidence of the land took place, and the area of the land diminished;
  but the area enclosed by the coral reefs did not diminish in a corresponding degree, and the young
  corals growing on the d&eacute;bris of the older ones as they sank continued the growth of the reef in a
  direction nearly vertical to the sea-bottom. The fringing reefs thus became barrier reefs, and
  they were separated from the land by a lagoon of considerable depth. Finally, when the mountain
  peaks disappeared beneath the waves, a ring-shaped reef or atoll was all that was left to mark the
  position of the former land.</p>

  <p>The fundamental assumption in the subsidence-theory is that <span class="pagenum"
  id="page392"><span class="smaller">{392}</span></span>the substratum of the coral reefs and
  islands is coral-formed limestone. To test the truth of this assumption an expedition was sent out
  to obtain, by boring, evidence of the character of the substratum of a typical atoll. The island
  of Funafuti in the Ellice group of the Pacific Ocean was selected, and after several attempts a
  successful boring was made to a depth of 1114 feet. The material from the boring was found to
  consist of rocks or sands entirely derived from the calcareous skeletons of marine Invertebrate
  animals and calcareous Algae.<a id="NtA_410" href="#Nt_410"><sup>[410]</sup></a> Moreover, in the
  cores from various depths down to the lowermost the fossilised skeletons of the common genera of
  recent corals, and very few or no representatives of genera of corals now extinct were
  discovered.</p>

  <p>These facts, therefore, prove the justice of Darwin's assumption as to the nature of the
  substratum&mdash;and give support to the subsidence-theory as applied to this particular island. A
  strong opinion has, however, been expressed by several authors of recent years that the
  subsidence-theory cannot account for the formation of all the atolls and barrier reefs that have
  now been investigated, and alternate hypotheses have been put forward to account for particular
  cases. The main chain of the Maldive Archipelago in the Indian Ocean, for example, presents
  special difficulties to the acceptance of the subsidence-theory as one of general application.<a
  id="NtA_411" href="#Nt_411"><sup>[411]</sup></a> The main chain of these islands is more than 300
  miles long, and lies at right angles to the monsoon currents of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page393"><span class="smaller">{393}</span></span>Indian Ocean. Here the action of the
  currents appears to have cut down a great tract of land to form a plateau more than 100 fathoms in
  depth. The outer rim of this plateau may have grown in height by the deposit of the skeletons of
  surface-swimming animals, and the skeletons of deep-sea corals, until it reached a level where
  reef-forming corals can thrive. A certain number of channels would be retained and even deepened
  as the rim grew up, and thus the coral would eventually reach the surface not as a single large
  atoll, but as a series of coral islands. When the coral reef has thus reached the surface and
  cannot grow farther in height, it spreads radially like a fairy ring on the talus formed by broken
  corals that have fallen down the slopes. The central parts, no longer protected by living
  organisms, are continually subject to the solvent action of the sea water penetrating the porous
  substratum, and sink to form the lagoon.</p>

  <p>It is not only in the reefs of the Indian Ocean, however, but in many of the archipelagoes of
  the Pacific Ocean, where there is evidence of very extensive elevation of the land areas in the
  neighbourhood of atolls and barrier reefs, that the subsidence-theory does not satisfactorily
  account for all the observed facts. It appears probable, therefore, that although a gradual
  subsidence of the land may have been the primary cause of coral reef formation in some areas,
  similar reefs may have been formed in other areas by other natural methods.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Corals.</b>&mdash;A great number of the genera of corals found in the newer Tertiary
  deposits, and a smaller number of those occurring in the older Tertiary and Cretaceous strata
  clearly belong to families now represented by recent corals. In the earlier strata, however,
  fossils are found which cannot be placed in our system with any degree of certainty. Attempts have
  been made from time to time to arrange these corals in their proper positions by the careful study
  and comparison of their skeletal features, but the reasons given are not convincing. The genus
  <i>Syringopora</i>, and the families Favositidae, Heliolitidae, and Coccoseridae have been noticed
  in the chapter on Alcyonaria (pp. <a href="#page343">343-346</a>). The family Zaphrentidae will be
  noticed when dealing with the order Zoanthidea.</p>

  <p>Among the families of fossil corals of uncertain position which may still be included in the
  order Madreporaria, the more important are<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page394"><span class="smaller">{394}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Cyathophyllidae</b>, a family of solitary and colonial corals with numerous radially
  arranged septa, extending from the Silurian to the Carboniferous limestone. It includes the genera
  <i>Cyathophyllum</i>, which was very abundant in Devonian times, and <i>Lithostrotion</i>, which,
  in the times of the formation of the Carboniferous limestone, occurred in continuous masses
  extending over great areas of the sea-bottom. The Cyathophyllidae may possibly be ancestral to the
  representatives of both Astraeidae and Fungiidae, which appeared in the Triassic strata.</p>

  <p>The <b>Cyathaxoniidae</b> form a family of solitary turbinate or horn-shaped corals, with septa
  showing a regular, radial arrangement, and may have been the ancestors of the modern family
  Turbinoliidae. They have the same geological range as the Cyathophyllidae.</p>

  <p>The <b>Cystiphyllidae</b>.&mdash;This family consists of solitary corals with very thin septa;
  the interseptal spaces are filled with an abundant vesicular substance called the "stereoplasm."
  The systematic position of this family is very doubtful, as the structure is evidently much
  destroyed, but by some authors it is supposed to be ancestral to the family Eupsammiidae.</p>

  <p class="sp3">These three families, together with the Zaphrentidae (p. <a
  href="#page406">406</a>), were formerly grouped together as the Tetracoralla or Rugosa.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order 1. Entocnemaria.</b></p>

  <p>Madreporaria forming perforate coralla, with calices that do not project above, or project only
  slightly above the surface of the coenosarc. The zooids of each colony are usually small and
  crowded. The mesenteries arise in bilateral pairs, and the increase in their number takes place in
  the chamber between the ventral or the dorsal pairs of directives. The corals included in this
  order are among the most important of the reef-builders. On many of the recent coral reefs they
  occur in enormous numbers and of great individual size. But although so prevalent upon recent
  reefs, they appear to have played a far less important part in the formation of the reefs of the
  early Tertiary times, and in the reefs of times antecedent to the Tertiary they were rare or
  absent.</p>

  <p>Judging from the structure of the skeleton and the palaeontological history alone it might be
  thought that the Entocnemaria <span class="pagenum" id="page395"><span
  class="smaller">{395}</span></span>represent the most recent types of Madreporarian structure, but
  the anatomy of the zooids points to a contrary conclusion. The zooids are of very simple
  structure; the mesenteries are found only in bilateral pairs, and all the new mesenteries formed
  after the protocnemes originate in one of the directive chambers. These are characters indicating
  a very ancient history, suggesting affinities with the Edwardsiidea on the one hand, and some
  ancient type of Cerianthidea on the other. There can be little doubt that it was owing to the
  evolution of a porous skeleton of rapid growth that these corals have caught up and passed the
  Astraeidae and other more specialised forms in the struggle for predominance on the coral
  reefs.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Madreporidae.</b>&mdash;The calices of the corallum are small and contain a few
  perfectly distinct septa. The coenosteum is porous and contains a plexus of the coenosarcal
  canals, which connects the cavities of neighbouring zooids. This family is divided into a number
  of sub-families, but it is only necessary here to mention the peculiarities of a few of the
  well-known genera.</p>

  <p><i>Madrepora.</i>&mdash;This genus is represented by an immense number of forms on the coral
  reefs of both the old and new world. Attempts have been made at various times to divide these
  forms into specific groups, and a large number of species have been defined and named. The
  differences between these species, however, are such as may be due to varying conditions of life
  upon the reefs and not to characters transmitted from generation to generation by heredity. There
  can be no doubt that when our knowledge of the soft tissues of these corals is extended the number
  of species will be greatly reduced. There are, however, three principal forms of growth or
  <i>facies</i> in the genus.</p>

  <p>1. The flabellate or palmate colonies with large flat or concave fronds, radiating from an
  encrusting base: <i>Forma palmata</i>.</p>

  <p>2. Much branched colonies, several branches radiating obliquely from a common centre: <i>Forma
  prolifera</i>.</p>

  <p>3. Large and more erect colonies, less branched except towards the periphery: <i>Forma
  cervicornis</i>.</p>

  <p>On some reefs one of these forms of growth predominates, and for miles the reef seems to be
  built up mainly of corals of this shape. On other reefs two or sometimes all three of these forms
  may be found within a stone's throw of one another. <span class="pagenum" id="page396"><span
  class="smaller">{396}</span></span>Notwithstanding the difficulty of distinguishing the species,
  the genus itself is quite well defined. The calices project slightly from the surface of the
  branches and contain six septa, of which the pair that is parallel with the axis of the branch is
  the strongest. This strong pair of septa can usually be well seen when a slender branch of a
  Madrepore is examined by a lens by transmitted light. At the apex of each branch there is a
  terminal zooid and in the skeleton an apical calyx. The terminal zooid is (in some species at
  least) different from the lateral or radial zooids. The former is radially symmetrical and has six
  long equal digitiform tentacles, the latter have usually twelve tentacles, of which six are larger
  than the others. These tentacles alternate, but they are so arranged on the disc as to give a
  distinctly bilateral appearance to the zooids.</p>

  <p>The colour of the West Indian Madrepores appears to be entirely due to Zooxanthellae (pp. <a
  href="#page86">86</a>, <a href="#page125">125</a>). They are lighter or darker shades of brown,
  sometimes becoming green, yellow, or orange. On the Australian barrier reef and other reefs of the
  eastern seas the growing points of the branches are variable and often brilliantly coloured,
  emerald green, violet, or red; giving some of the most wonderful colour effects for which the reef
  pools are famous. The cause of these brilliant apical colours has not yet been ascertained.</p>

  <p>The genus is found in shallow water of all seas of the tropical belt except on the western side
  of the continent of America.</p>

  <p><i>Montipora.</i>&mdash;In this genus the calices are small and situated in depressions in the
  coenosteum, and there are six, sometimes twelve, septa of approximately equal size. There is no
  terminal calyx at the apex of the branches. This is a genus of very variable form and wide
  distribution in all tropical seas except on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

  <p><i>Turbinaria.</i>&mdash;This genus is usually cup-shaped or foliaceous and twisted in form.
  The septa may be six to thirty in number. Some of the species of this genus attain to a very great
  size in favourable localities. There is a specimen in the British Museum that is 16 feet in
  circumference and weighed, when dried, 1500 lbs.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Poritidae.</b>&mdash;The corallum is usually encrusting, foliaceous, lobed or
  tufted, rarely dendritic. The whole skeleton is built up of a system of trabeculae and stout cross
  bars, and in <span class="pagenum" id="page397"><span class="smaller">{397}</span></span>section
  the limits of the calices are not well defined. The septa are represented by twelve trabeculae.
  The zooids are small and are usually provided with twelve tentacles. The most important genus is
  <i>Porites</i>, which is so abundant on many reefs that it may be said to rival <i>Madrepora</i>
  itself in the luxuriance of its growth. On the Australian barrier reef a species of <i>Porites</i>
  builds up coralla over twenty feet in length and as many in height. According to Saville Kent they
  are usually found on the outer side of the reef and form a basis of support for the high-level
  Madreporas and other corals.<a id="NtA_412" href="#Nt_412"><sup>[412]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The colours of <i>Porites</i> are very variable and often beautiful. In Jamaica<a id="NtA_413"
  href="#Nt_413"><sup>[413]</sup></a> the prevailing colours are bright blue, pale yellow, and
  yellowish green. In Australia the colours are less brilliant perhaps, but among the prevailing
  tints are light or bright lilac, a delicate pink, dark yellow, and brown. The genus <i>Porites</i>
  occurs in Eocene and Miocene deposits, and is now found on all the more important coral reefs of
  the world.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The genus <i>Alveopora</i> is usually placed with the Poritidae. According to
  Bernard,<a id="NtA_414" href="#Nt_414"><sup>[414]</sup></a> however, its affinities with this
  family are remote, and it is more closely related to the Favositidae (see p. <a
  href="#page344">344</a>). The walls of the calices are contiguous and the septa are reduced to
  rows of spines, as in the Favositidae. It is found in shallow water in the Pacific, the Indian
  Ocean, and the Red Sea.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order 2. Cyclocnemaria.</b></p>

  <p>Madreporaria forming perforate or imperforate coralla. Solitary or colonial. The zooids have
  usually a large number of mesenteries arranged in two or more cycles. The mesenteries beyond the
  protocnemic pairs arise in unilateral pairs in chambers other than those between the
  directives.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sect. 1. Aporosa.</span>&mdash;Cyclocnemaria in which the theca and septa are
  not perforated. The zooids of the colonial forms may communicate by means of superficial canals of
  the coenosarc, or they may be in contact with one another only at their edges.</p>

  <p>Several families are included in this section, of which the more important are<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page398"><span class="smaller">{398}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Turbinoliidae.</b>&mdash;The corals included in this family are mostly solitary
  forms attached to foreign objects, or living partly embedded in sand. In some cases a small colony
  is formed by gemmation.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Flabellum</i> is a solitary coral of a compressed top shape. It has a large number
  of septa arranged radially on the cup-wall. This cup-wall is not a true theca but an epitheca. In
  some forms root-like tubes grow out from the sides of the cup near its base and may serve to
  support the coral on solid objects. In some remarkably fine specimens recently obtained from the
  Persian Gulf these tubes served to attach the coral to a telegraph cable. <i>Flabellum</i> seems
  to be cosmopolitan in its distribution. It is usually found in deep or moderately deep water, but
  some specimens have been dredged in water of 2 to 9 fathoms.</p>

      Bourne.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>Caryophyllia</i> is a conical coral fixed by a slightly expanded base. The cup-wall is a
  true theca covered below by an epitheca. There is a spongy columella surrounded by a single circle
  of pali. There is one British species, <i>C. smithii</i>. It is found attached to shells at a
  depth of about thirty fathoms near the Eddystone Lighthouse and in other localities in the English
  Channel. It also occurs between tide marks in the Scilly Islands, and is found off the Shetlands,
  on the west coast of Scotland, and the south-west of Ireland. The genus is widely distributed and
  extends from shallow water to depths of 1500 fathoms. <i>Caryophyllia</i> sometimes occurs in
  clusters which have the appearance of an incipient colony. This may be due to the embryos fixing
  themselves upon the epitheca of existing individuals and developing there. It is doubtful whether
  the species ever reproduce asexually either by gemmation or by fission. When the zooid is fully
  expanded it projects some distance above the corallum and shows a very transparent body-wall with
  a crown of some fifty tentacles. Each tentacle terminates in a globose head (Fig. 169) charged
  with nematocysts. The general colour is pale pink, and there is a broad brown circle <span
  class="pagenum" id="page399"><span class="smaller">{399}</span></span>round the mouth. Large
  specimens may be three-quarters of an inch in diameter.</p>

  <p><i>Turbinolia</i> is a common Eocene fossil genus found in England and France, and is stated to
  occur in the Caribbean Sea. The columella stands up like a stylet and the septa are "exsert,"
  <i>i.e.</i> project above the rim of the theca.</p>

  <p><i>Trochocyathus</i> is a genus with well-marked "costae" occurring in tropical shallow water
  (Fig. 174).</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Oculinidae.</b>&mdash;Colonial forms, dendritic or encrusting, with relatively large
  and rather prominent calices separated by considerable stretches of compact coenosteum. The zooids
  bear a crown of ten to forty-eight or more capitate tentacles.</p>

  <p><i>Neohelia</i> has a fistulose stem lined internally by a horny membrane. There seems to be
  some reason for supposing that this membrane is formed by the zooids themselves. A similar
  membrane is found in the fistulose stems of <i>Amphihelia</i> and perhaps other Oculinidae. If
  this membrane is really formed by the activity of the corals it forms an exception to the general
  rule that the skeleton of the Madreporaria is entirely calcareous. Others maintain, however, that
  this membrane is formed by the Chaetopod worms which are found in the tubes, and that the
  fistulose stem of the coral is formed by folding round and encrusting the horny tubes of the worm.
  <i>Neohelia</i> is found in the Pacific Ocean.<a id="NtA_415"
  href="#Nt_415"><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Lophohelia</i> is a genus forming dendritic colonies of considerable size. The calices have
  thick walls and are very deep. <i>Lophohelia prolifera</i> has been found in deep water off the
  island of Skye and in other localities off the west coast of Scotland. It is also not uncommon in
  some of the Norwegian fjords and in other parts of the world.</p>

  <p><i>Oculina</i> is another widely distributed genus found in the shallow tropical waters of the
  West Indies, the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It forms dendritic colonies of considerable size. The
  calices are usually arranged in a spiral manner on the branches. The colour of the West Indian
  species is stated to be light or dark brown when alive. The tentacles are arranged in three
  cycles, and are usually twenty-four in number. Asexual reproduction takes place by budding at the
  apex of the branches.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Astraeidae.</b>&mdash;This is a very large family, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page400"><span class="smaller">{400}</span></span>authorities are not agreed as to its limits
  or classification. Excluding the simple forms for the present, the family may be said to be
  distinguished by having the calices so closely crowded that there is little or no coenosteum
  between them. The corallum is compact and massive, unless bored and perforated by algae, worms,
  and other coral-destroying organisms.</p>

  <p>The genera of Astraeidae that form colonies may be divided into two groups: the <span
  class="sc">Gemmantes</span> and the <span class="sc">Fissiparantes</span>. In the group <span
  class="sc">Gemmantes</span> asexual reproduction is effected by gemmation, and each zooid of a
  colony is a distinct individual with two pairs of directive mesenteries. Among the best known of
  recent corals included in this group may be mentioned <i>Galaxea</i>. In this genus there is a
  good deal more coenosteum between the calices than there is in most of the Astraeidae. The calices
  are long and project some distance above the coenosteum. The septa are exsert. In <i>Galaxea
  esperi</i> examined by Fowler<a id="NtA_416" href="#Nt_416"><sup>[416]</sup></a> there are twelve
  septa, twelve pairs of mesenteries, and twenty-four tentacles, of which twelve are very small and
  twelve rather larger. The colour is green or brown. The genus is found in shallow water in the
  tropics of the old world.</p>

  <p>In <i>Astrangia solitaria</i> the zooids are either isolated or more generally united by thin
  strands of perithecal tissue to form encrusting colonies. The septa are not exsert as in
  <i>Galaxea</i>. Six are prominent and belong to the first cycle, six smaller ones form a second
  cycle, and an incomplete third and fourth cycle may be seen. Corresponding with each septum there
  is a tentacle. The tentacles of the innermost cycle are the longest (3 mm. in length). All the
  tentacles terminate in a knobbed apex. The living zooids are colourless throughout, or display
  only very delicate tints within restricted areas.<a id="NtA_417"
  href="#Nt_417"><sup>[417]</sup></a> This genus occurs principally on the coasts of the American
  continent, extending as far south as the Straits of Magellan. Other well-known genera of
  Astraeidae Gemmantes are <i>Orbicella</i>, <i>Cladocora</i>, <i>Phyllangia</i>.</p>

  <p>In the group <span class="sc">Fissiparantes</span> asexual production takes place by fission
  without the production of morphologically complete zooids. The tentacles, mesenteries, and septa,
  when fission is established, are not arranged in regular hexameral cycles, and no <span
  class="pagenum" id="page401"><span class="smaller">{401}</span></span>new directive mesenteries
  arise. In some cases very large corals are formed, and, if our conception is correct, these must
  be regarded, not as a colony of zooids, but as a single individual zooid divided into a
  considerable number of incompletely separated parts. Among the well-known genera belonging to this
  group are <i>Euphyllia</i>, <i>Mussa</i>, <i>Meandrina</i>, <i>Coeloria</i>, <i>Favia</i>, and
  <i>Goniastraea</i>.</p>

  <p>In such genera as <i>Euphyllia</i> the parts of the colony become separated by deep grooves,
  and have the superficial appearance of being distinct individuals; but in the Brain-coral
  <i>Coeloria</i> and others the surface of the coral presents a series of more or less bent or
  curved grooves, each with a row of slit-shaped mouths and bordered by rows of tentacles.</p>

  <p>A number of genera of solitary corals united in the subfamily Trochosmiliacea are generally
  included in the family Astraeidae. The study of their skeletal characters has suggested<a
  id="NtA_418" href="#Nt_418"><sup>[418]</sup></a> that they are more closely allied to the
  Turbinoliidae. The principal genera thus transferred would be <i>Trochosmilia</i>,
  <i>Placosmilia</i>, <i>Parasmilia</i>, and <i>Asterosmilia</i>. As these genera and their allies
  are nearly all extinct, and nothing is known of the structure of the living zooids, their removal
  from the Astraeidae may be regarded as not fully justified.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Pocilloporidae.</b>&mdash;The general anatomy of the zooids of this family of corals
  has some resemblance to that of the Entocnemaria, and it is possible that they will eventually
  find a place in our classification near to, if not actually within that group. The fact, however,
  that the skeleton is imperforate is sufficient for the present to justify the inclusion of the
  family in the section Aporosa. There are but two genera at present known, and in both of them the
  zooids have twelve tentacles, twelve mesenteries, and only two mesenterial filaments. The zooids
  are connected together by an elaborate system of canals running in the superficial coenosarc. The
  calices are bilaterally symmetrical, and in <i>Seriatopora</i> the septa which are parallel with
  the axis of the branch are united in the centre of the calyx, and are very much larger than the
  others, as in <i>Madrepora</i>. In all these characters the family shows affinities with the
  Entocnemaria. In the characters of the skeleton, which is imperforate and tabulate, the affinities
  are rather with the <span class="pagenum" id="page402"><span
  class="smaller">{402}</span></span>Cyclocnemaria. The two genera are widely distributed on the
  coral reefs of the old world, and in some localities are very abundant. Neither genus is found in
  the West Indies. They are both of recent origin, but <i>Pocillopora</i> occurs in the Miocene. It
  is a remarkable feature of the family that both genera may be attacked by the gall-forming crab
  <i>Hapalocarcinus</i>. From some reefs nearly all the Pocilloporidae show crab-galls on a large
  number of their branches, whereas other Madreporaria are free from them.</p>

  <p><i>Pocillopora</i> is a coral that forms encrusting masses, rising into lobes or branches of
  considerable size, terminating in blunt apices. <i>Seriatopora</i> is much more slender and
  ramified, the branches terminating in sharp points.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Sect. 2. Fungacea.</span>&mdash;This section of Cyclocnemaria contains a
  number of solitary and colonial corals of very varied form united in the possession of a number of
  cross-bars called "synapticula" connecting the septa, and thereby giving strength to the calyx
  apart from any increase in the thickness of the calyx-wall. The family Fungiidae shows many
  peculiarities which separate it very distinctly from both the Cyclocnemaria and the Aporosa. The
  Eupsammiidae, however, approach the <span class="pagenum" id="page403"><span
  class="smaller">{403}</span></span>Cyclocnemaria in many respects, and the Plesiofungiidae form a
  connecting link with the Astraeidae. It is very probable that this section had a dual origin, and
  therefore does not represent a single line of descent.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Plesiofungiidae.</b>&mdash;This family is related to the Aporosa in the possession
  of septa that are generally solid and imperforate, and to the Astraeidae in particular in the
  possession of dissepiments. They differ from them, however, in the presence of synapticula and in
  certain peculiarities of the tentacles.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Siderastraea</i> has recently been studied by Duerden.<a id="NtA_419"
  href="#Nt_419"><sup>[419]</sup></a> The colony is usually massive and encrusting in habit. The
  zooids when expanded do not rise much above the level of the corallum. The tentacles are short and
  are arranged in irregular cycles on the disc. They terminate in knobbed extremities, and those of
  the inner cycles are bifurcated. The colour of <i>S. sideraea</i> is reddish-brown when alive.
  <i>Siderastraea</i> is found in shallow water on the coral reefs, and is widely distributed.</p>

  <p>In <i>Agaricia</i> the colony is more foliaceous. The tentacles are rudimentary or small. The
  colour of the living zooids is very similar to that of <i>Siderastraea</i>.
  <i>Epistrelophyllum</i> is a solitary coral, from the Jurassic series, belonging to the
  family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Fungiidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Fungia</i> is an unattached solitary coral of a flat
  disc-like shape with very numerous exsert imperforate septa. It is frequently of considerable size
  (six to twelve inches in diameter). On many of the coral reefs of the old world it is extremely
  abundant, and consequently it is one of the commonest corals of our collections. When alive the
  corallum is almost hidden by the disc, which is studded all over with very numerous long
  tentacles.<a id="NtA_420" href="#Nt_420"><sup>[420]</sup></a> The colour varies in different
  species, but is usually brown. One species on the Australian barrier reef, <i>F.
  crassitentaculata</i>, is of a dark olive green colour, the tentacles terminating in white
  knobs.</p>

  <p>The free adult Fungias are derived from a fixed stock called the trophozooid, from which the
  young Fungias are detached by transverse fission (see p. <a href="#page388">388</a>). The thecal
  wall of the young <i>Fungia</i> when detached from the trophozooid is perforated, but <span
  class="pagenum" id="page404"><span class="smaller">{404}</span></span>the pores become largely
  filled up during the later growth of the coral.</p>

  <p>There are several genera of colonial Fungiidae of less frequent occurrence, such as
  <i>Halomitra</i>, <i>Herpetolitha</i>, and <i>Cryptabacia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Cycloseridae.</b>&mdash;These are solitary or colonial Fungacea with an imperforate
  theca. <i>Bathyactis</i> occurs at great depths. <i>Diaseris</i>, shallow water on coral
  reefs.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 8. Plesioporitidae.</b>&mdash;The septa in this family are trabeculate and perforate,
  resembling in this respect the septa of Poritidae. <i>Leptophyllia</i>, <i>Microsolena</i>,
  extinct.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 9. Eupsammiidae.</b>&mdash;This family of perforate corals is usually placed with the
  Madreporidae and Poritidae in the old group Perforata. The researches of Fowler and Gardiner have
  shown that the arrangement of the mesenteries is that of the Cyclocnemaria, and the presence of
  synapticula connecting the septa suggests affinities with the Fungacea. The synapticula of the
  Eupsammiidae, however, are peculiar in being arranged, not in a vertical series, but alternately
  with one another or quite irregularly in position. The members of this family are solitary or
  colonial in habit.</p>

  <p><i>Stephanophyllia</i> is a flattened disc-shaped coral, with perforate and dentate septa,
  found in the Pacific Ocean and as a fossil in various strata since Cretaceous times.</p>

  <p>In <i>Leptopenus</i>, from depths of about 1500 fathoms, the perforations are much larger than
  in the last-named genus, and the skeleton is reduced to a system of slender trabeculae.</p>

  <p><i>Rhodopsammia</i> has a conical shape, and gives rise by gemmation to a number of young
  zooids, which remain attached for some time to the parent form before becoming free.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Among the colonial genera are <i>Dendrophyllia</i>, <i>Coenopsammia</i>, and the
  well-known Mediterranean genus <i>Astroides</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order IV. Zoanthidea.</b></p>

  <p>This order of Zoantharia consists of a number of solitary or colonial Anemones that do not form
  a skeleton of horn or carbonate of lime, and are distinguished from the Actiniaria by the peculiar
  arrangement of their mesenteries.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Zoanthidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Sphenopus</i> is a solitary coral and terminates aborally
  in a small sucker-like base, by which it may <span class="pagenum" id="page405"><span
  class="smaller">{405}</span></span>be attached to foreign bodies. The genera <i>Gemmaria</i> and
  <i>Isaurus</i> include solitary forms.</p>

  <p>In the majority of the species of Zoanthids, however, a basal encrusting stolon is formed,
  which may be thick and fleshy or membranous, or may consist of a plexus of bands from which
  several zooids rise and on which the new buds are formed.</p>

  <p>The tentacles are numerous, simple, usually short, and arranged in one or two circles on the
  margin of the disc. Most Zoanthidae are encrusted with sand, shell fragments, or sponge spicules,
  but <i>Zoanthus</i> and <i>Isaurus</i> are naked. The foreign particles that form the incrustation
  are firmly attached to the ectoderm, and as a rule many of them sink down into the mesogloea to
  give additional support to the body-wall. It is the presence of so much incorporated sand that
  frequently gives these Zoantharia such a very brittle character. The stomodaeum usually exhibits a
  well-marked ventral siphonoglyph. The mesenteries consist of a pair of complete ventral
  directives, a pair of incomplete dorsal directives, while of the remaining protocnemes the lateral
  mesenteries which are first and second in the order of appearance are complete, the sixth is
  incomplete, whereas the fifth is complete in the Macrocneminae and incomplete in the
  Brachycneminae. Duerden<a id="NtA_421" href="#Nt_421"><sup>[421]</sup></a> has found in specimens
  of three species that the arrangement of the mesenteries is "brachycnemic" (the sixth protocneme
  imperfect) on one side and "macrocnemic" (the sixth protocneme perfect) on the other. The
  metacnemes appear in the spaces between the sixth protocnemes and the ventral directives in
  unilateral pairs, of which one becomes complete and the other always remains incomplete (Fig. 163,
  <span class="smaller">4</span>, p. <a href="#page368">368</a>).</p>

  <p>The Zoanthidae are usually dioecious, but hermaphroditism undoubtedly occurs in the genera
  <i>Zoanthus</i> and <i>Isaurus</i>. Little is known of their development, but a larval form
  discovered by Semper off the Cape of Good Hope, of cylindrical shape, with an opening at each end
  and distinguished by a longitudinal band of cilia running from one end to the other, is probably
  the larva of a Zoanthid. It is commonly known as Semper's larva. Other larvae provided with a ring
  of cilia have also been attributed to this group.</p>

  <p>A great many Zoanthidae are epizoic in habit. Thus several <span class="pagenum"
  id="page406"><span class="smaller">{406}</span></span>species of <i>Epizoanthus</i> form colonies
  on the shells of Gasteropods inhabited by hermit crabs. <i>Parazoanthus tunicans</i> is found on
  the stem of a <i>Plumularia</i>; <i>Parazoanthus separatus</i>, from Jamaica, is associated with a
  sponge. The base of the bundle of long spicules of the Sponge <i>Hyalonema</i> (p. <a
  href="#page204">204</a>) is almost invariably sheathed by a colony of <i>Epizoanthus
  stellaris</i>.</p>

  <p>The only genera occurring within the British area are <i>Epizoanthus</i> (with six species),
  <i>Parazoanthus</i> (with four species), and <i>Zoanthus sulcatus</i>.</p>

  <p>Of the species of <i>Epizoanthus</i>, <i>E. incrustatus</i> is fairly common, in depths of
  twenty to eighty fathoms on all our coasts, and is frequently commensal with different species of
  hermit crabs, while <i>E. paguriphilus</i> is found in much deeper water off the west coast of
  Ireland and is always commensal with hermit crabs. <i>Parazoanthus anguicomus</i> is found at
  depths of a hundred fathoms off the Shetlands and west of Ireland, and is usually associated with
  various species of Sponges.</p>

  <p><i>Gerardia savalia</i> is the largest "black coral" of the Mediterranean. The colony begins by
  encrusting the stem of one of the Gorgoniidae, but soon surpassing its support in growth, it forms
  a basal horny skeleton of its own and builds up very large branching colonies. A specimen in the
  British Museum,<a id="NtA_422" href="#Nt_422"><sup>[422]</sup></a> from twenty fathoms off the
  island Negropont, is two metres high and two metres wide. The genus appears to be related
  anatomically to <i>Parazoanthus</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 2. Zaphrentidae.</b>&mdash;This family of Palaeozoic corals is usually
  placed with the Turbinoliidae or in the separate group Tetracoralla. Recently Duerden<a
  id="NtA_423" href="#Nt_423"><sup>[423]</sup></a> has given reasons, based on the method of
  increase of the septa in <i>Lophophyllum</i>, for believing that their affinities lie rather with
  the Zoanthidae than <span class="pagenum" id="page407"><span
  class="smaller">{407}</span></span>with the Madreporaria. They are solitary turbinate corals, with
  numerous septa exhibiting a distinct bilateral symmetry in arrangement. <i>Zaphrentis</i>,
  <i>Lophophyllum</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order V. Antipathidea = Antipatharia.</b></p>

  <p>The members of this order can readily be distinguished from all other Zoantharia by the
  presence of a horny axial skeleton (sclerobase) and the absence of any spicules of calcium
  carbonate. The skeleton is covered by a thin bark which consists of a number of simple, naked
  zooids united at their edges. The zooids bear six tentacles, or if there are more than six, six
  large prominent tentacles. In most genera there are but ten mesenteries, in others twelve. In
  <i>Cladopathes</i> only six mesenteries are found. The skeleton of the Antipathidea is simple in
  <i>Stichopathes</i> and <i>Cirripathes</i>, but in all other genera it is ramified. The
  ramification is usually profuse and irregular. The horny substance of which it is composed is free
  from any deposit or infiltration of lime. The surface of the younger branches is beset with
  numerous short spines, the number and arrangement of which are characters largely used in the
  determination of species. The basal parts of the main axis and the thicker branches are frequently
  bare, the zooids having died and become disintegrated. In these cases the spines wear away and the
  skeleton appears to be smooth. The presence of spines on some of the branches is, however,
  generally sufficient to enable the naturalist to distinguish a dried Antipathid from the axis of a
  Gorgonid, with which alone it might be confounded.</p>

  <p>There are six complete mesenteries in each zooid, but as they bear no retractor muscles it is
  not certain that they represent the first six protocnemes of other Zoantharia. In a great many
  species the zooids are oval in shape, the longer diameter being parallel with the axis of the
  branch. The mouth and stomodaeum are compressed and at right angles to this diameter. It is
  usually assumed that the mesenteries attached to the angles of the stomodaeum are the directives,
  and that the remaining pair, which is axial in direction, corresponds with the first pair of
  protocnemes. The axial pair of mesenteries is frequently very well developed and alone bears the
  gonads. When other mesenteries are formed they always arise in bilateral pairs between the axial
  mesenteries <span class="pagenum" id="page408"><span class="smaller">{408}</span></span>and the
  directives. The tentacles correspond with the intermesenteric chambers. In some genera there is a
  constriction of the zooid between the pairs of the tentacles on each side of the axial mesenteries
  and the directive tentacles. This gives them the appearance of a division into three zooids with
  two tentacles apiece, one with a mouth and two without a mouth; and as the mouthless parts alone
  bear the gonads on the single axial mesentery, they have been called the "gastrozooids" and
  "gonozooids" respectively. This must not be regarded, however, as a case of true dimorphism, as
  the cavities of the so-called gastrozooid and gonozooids are continuous.</p>

  <p>The Antipatharia are widely distributed in nearly all the great seas of the world. Some species
  are found in shallow water in the tropics, but most of them occur in depths of fifty to five
  hundred fathoms. The genus <i>Bathypathes</i> is only found at enormous depths ranging from 1070
  to 2900 fathoms. Specimens of <i>Cirripathes spiralis</i>, <i>Antipathella gracilis</i>, and
  another species have recently been obtained in deep water off the west coast of Ireland,<a
  id="NtA_424" href="#Nt_424"><sup>[424]</sup></a> but these are the only Antipatharia known to
  occur within the British area.</p>

  <p>The very simple structure of the Antipatharia is usually attributed to degeneration. On this
  view the Antipathidae with only six complete mesenteries are the most modified, whereas the
  Leiopathidae with twelve mesenteries are more closely related to the ancestral forms, and
  <i>Gephyra dohrnii</i> (see p. <a href="#page382">382</a>) is a link connecting the order with the
  Actiniaria.</p>

  <p>There is no reason, however, for supposing that <i>Gephyra</i> is specially related to this
  order, and, as pointed out recently by Roule,<a id="NtA_425" href="#Nt_425"><sup>[425]</sup></a>
  the simple structure of the zooids of the Antipathidea is more easily explained if they are
  regarded as primitive forms.</p>

  <p><i>Gerardia</i> (p. <a href="#page406">406</a>), from the Mediterranean, forms a horny axial
  skeleton like that of the Antipathidea, but this genus is probably a Zoanthid.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Antipathidae.</b>&mdash;In this family the zooids have six tentacles and six or ten
  mesenteries. It includes nearly all the familiar genera, such as <i>Stichopathes</i>,
  <i>Cirripathes</i>, <i>Antipathes</i>, <i>Antipathella</i>, <i>Cladopathes</i>, and
  <i>Bathypathes</i>. <i>Schizopathes</i> and <span class="pagenum" id="page409"><span

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Leiopathidae.</b>&mdash;This family includes the single genus <i>Leiopathes</i> of
  the Mediterranean Sea. It is distinguished from the others by the presence of twelve
  mesenteries.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 3. Dendrobrachiidae.</b>&mdash;This family also consists of a single genus,
  <i>Dendrobrachia</i>, from 400 fathoms in the South Atlantic. It is distinguished by having
  pinnate retractile tentacles.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order VI. Cerianthidea.</b></p>

  <p>This order contains the remarkable Sea-anemone called <i>Cerianthus</i>. Two of the species
  have been placed in separate genera, but they do not appear to be of more than sub-generic rank.
  <i>Cerianthus</i> has a long cylindrical body with a double crown of numerous long tentacles at
  the oral extremity and tapering to a blunt point or rounded at the aboral extremity.</p>

  <p>There are numerous mesenteries, which increase in number by the addition of bilateral pairs,
  arising only in the ventral inter-mesenteric space throughout the greater part, if not the whole,
  of the life of the zooid. The right mesentery of each young pair is always more advanced than the
  left, so that the mesenteries have the appearance of arising alternately right and left. None of
  the mesenteries bear conspicuous bands of retractor muscles. The movements of the body are
  effected by a thick band of longitudinal fibres lying between the ectoderm and the mesogloea in
  the body-wall.</p>

  <p>The absence or very slight development of muscles on the mesenteries renders it difficult to
  recognise the homologues of the protocnemes of other Zoantharia in the adult. From the evidence of
  embryology, however, it seems certain that the six dorsal pairs of mesenteries represent the
  protocnemes (Fig. 163, <span class="smaller">3</span>, p. <a href="#page368">368</a>) and the
  others are metacnemes.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page410"><span class="smaller">{410}</span></span></div>

  <p>The stomodaeum exhibits a single long deep siphonoglyph, which is probably dorsal in
  position.</p>

  <p>There are two tentacles to each inter-mesenteric space, one being marginal and the other
  circumoral. The gonads are borne upon alternate mesenteries, and both ova and spermatozoa are
  produced by the same individual.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The ectoderm of <i>Cerianthus</i> is remarkable for the immense number of nematocysts and gland
  cells. The latter secrete a quantity of mucus which binds the threads of the discharged
  nematocysts into a sticky feltwork and this secures particles of sand and mud, the whole forming a
  long tube in which the animal freely moves. This tube is often of considerable thickness. It is
  tough and resistant, smooth inside but ragged and muddy outside. It is often many times the length
  of the animal's body.</p>

  <p>The embryo of <i>Cerianthus</i> is set free before the completion of segmentation, and it gives
  rise to a floating pelagic larva known as <i>Arachnactis</i>. It has a variable number of
  tentacles and mesenteries according to its age, but when it reaches a size of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page411"><span class="smaller">{411}</span></span>about 15 mm. in length it
  has developed characters which are sufficient to determine its position as a Cerianthid.</p>

  <p>The genus <i>Cerianthus</i> appears to be widely distributed. <i>C. membranaceus</i> is the
  common species in the Mediterranean Sea, but a smaller species has been described from Naples
  under the name <i>C. oligopodus</i> by Cerfontaine. <i>C. americanus</i> occurs on the eastern
  coasts of North America. The British and North European species is <i>C. lloydii</i>, but another
  species, <i>C. vogti</i>, has been found at a depth of 498 fathoms in the North Sea. <i>C.
  nobilis</i> is a gigantic species supposed to be about 1 foot in length when complete, from Torres
  Straits.</p>

  <p><i>C. bathymetricus</i> of Moseley, placed by Andres in the genus <i>Bathyanthus</i>, is a
  species of small size (25 mm.), obtained by the "Challenger" from a depth of 2750 fathoms in the
  North Atlantic. It exhibits a remarkable prolongation of the stomodaeum into the coelenteron in
  the form of a sack which contained food. Moseley described a species of <i>Cerianthus</i>, 6
  inches long, living on the coral reef at Zebu in the Philippines fully expanded in the tropical
  sunshine.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Several species of <i>Arachnactis</i> larvae have been described. Of these
  <i>Arachnactis lloydii</i> appears to be undoubtedly the larva of <i>C. lloydii</i>. The adult
  forms of <i>Arachnactis albida</i> from various stations in the Atlantic Ocean and of
  <i>Arachnactis americana</i> are not known. The larva of <i>Cerianthus membranaceus</i> has been
  called <i>Dianthea nobilis</i>, and is characterised by the great length of the column, by the
  general opacity of all parts of the body, and by the precocious appearance of the median marginal
  tentacle. A considerable number of remarkable pelagic larvae have been described by van Beneden<a
  id="NtA_426" href="#Nt_426"><sup>[426]</sup></a> from the Atlantic Ocean, and provisionally
  assigned by him to five different genera. The adult forms of these larvae are not known, but they
  are probably members of this order.</p>

  <p>The Ctenophora are spherical, lobed, thimble-shaped, or band-like animals, usually very

  as having closer affinities with the Polyclad Turbellaria (cf. Vol. II. p. 7). They agree,
  however, with neither of these divisions in their essential characters, and the only way to
  indicate and emphasise their unique position is to place them in a separate Phylum.</p>

  <p>They differ from all the Coelenterata in the absence of nematocysts, and in the presence in
  development of a definite mesoblast. The character from which they derive their name, Ctenophora,
  is the presence on the surface of bands of swimming plates. The plates are called the "combs"
  (<span title="kteis" class="fsn">&kappa;&tau;&epsilon;&#x03AF;&sigmaf;</span>, gen. <span
  title="ktenos" class="fsn">&kappa;&tau;&epsilon;&nu;&#x03CC;&sigmaf;</span> = a comb) or
  "ctenophoral plates." They occur in all genera included in the Phylum except in <i>Coeloplana</i>
  (Fig. 183, p. <a href="#page422">422</a>).</p>

  <p>Another peculiarity of all Ctenophora (except the Beroidae) is the presence, at some stage in
  the life-history, of two long and extremely contractile tentacles. There is also a well-developed
  sense-organ (statocyst) in the centre of the aboral area of the body.</p>

  <p>The Ctenophora differ from the Turbellaria in the presence of the combs and of the two long
  tentacles, in the position and relative importance of the statocyst, and, with the exception of
  <i>Coeloplana</i>, in the general characters of the alimentary canal.</p>

  <p><b>Shape.</b>&mdash;Several of the Ctenophora are conical or spherical in shape, but exhibit at
  the pole where the mouth is situated <span class="pagenum" id="page413"><span
  class="smaller">{413}</span></span>(Fig. 180, <i>M</i>) a slight conical projection, and at the
  opposite pole where the sense-organ is placed a slight depression (<i>Ab</i>). In others, the
  sides of the body are drawn out into a pair of wing-like lobes (Lobata), and the body is
  considerably flattened or compressed (Fig. 181). The Cestoidea have a long flattened ribbon- or
  band-shape (Fig. 182), and the Platyctenea (Fig. 183) are flattened in the oro-apical axis and
  exhibit a well-marked distinction between the dorsal and ventral surfaces. The shape of
  <i>Beroe</i> is that of a hollow cone or thimble.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Ctenophoral plates.</b>&mdash;In many Ctenophora eight lines can be traced, like the lines
  of longitude on a globe, from the area of the sense-organ to the base of the mouth-cone or
  hypostome. In the course of these lines are situated the ctenophoral plates. In some species they
  extend along the greater part of these lines of longitude, but in others they are more restricted.
  That part of the line that bears the plates is called the "rib" or "costa." These plates or combs
  form the principal organs of locomotion of the Ctenophores. They consist of a row of cilia fused
  at the base (cf. p. <a href="#page141">141</a>) to form the plate, but free at the extremity where
  they form the comb-like edge. They are alternately raised, by a rapid contractile action, and then
  slowly flattened down again. The plates are raised in succession from the aboral to the oral end
  of each rib, and the appearance given to the bands in the living animal is that of a series of
  waves travelling down the lines of longitude from the sensory area towards the mouth. The effect
  of these rhythmic movements of the combs is to <span class="pagenum" id="page414"><span
  class="smaller">{414}</span></span>drive the animal slowly through the water with the oral cone
  forwards. In some Ctenophores the cost&aelig; are phosphorescent.<a id="NtA_427"
  href="#Nt_427"><sup>[427]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Tentacles.</b>&mdash;In all the Ctenophora, except the Beroidae and the adult stages of
  Lobata and Cestoidea, there is a single pair of tentacles. They are attached to the base of a
  blind funnel-shaped pit which opens to the exterior near the equator of the animal's body. The
  pits are on opposite sides of the body, and the plane which passes through them both vertically
  divides the body into approximately equal parts. It is called the "tentacular" or "transverse"
  plane (Fig. 180). The plane at right angles to this, which also passes through the mouth and
  statocyst, is called the "sagittal" plane.</p>

  <p>The tentacles are solid, and in the Cydippidae, of considerable length. During life they are
  usually extended, and trail behind the animal as it progresses through the water. But they are
  extremely contractile, and when the animal is alarmed are suddenly withdrawn into the shelter of
  the tentacular pits. Each tentacle usually bears a row of short pinnae. The surfaces of the
  tentacles and of their pinnae are crowded with remarkable cells which carry little globules of an
  adhesive secretion, and are called the glue-cells or "colloblasts." These cells stick to any
  foreign body they touch, and may be drawn out some distance from the tentacle, but they remain
  attached to it by a long spiral thread which unwinds as the cell is pulled out. Although the
  colloblasts have the function of catching prey similar to that of the nematocysts of Coelenterata,
  they are true animal cells and are not therefore homologous with nematocysts, which are the cell
  products of the cnidoblasts.<a id="NtA_428" href="#Nt_428"><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Lobata and Cestoidea pass through a stage in development called the Cydippiform or
  <i>Mertensia</i> stage, when they possess a single pair of long tentacles similar to those
  described above. In the adult condition, however, these tentacles are absent, and their functions
  are performed by numerous small accessory tentacles or tentilla arranged in rows on definite lines
  along the body-wall.</p>

  <p><b>Sense-organ.</b>&mdash;At the aboral pole of the Ctenophore there is a hard granulated
  calcareous body, the "statolith." This is <span class="pagenum" id="page415"><span
  class="smaller">{415}</span></span>supported by four tufts of fused cilia, and is usually covered
  by a dome of delicate protoplasmic texture, which is believed to be formed by a fusion of cilia.
  The dome enclosing the statolith is called the "statocyst."</p>

  <p>Supporting the statocyst there is a circular or oval area of ciliated epithelium which is
  usually supposed, but on insufficient evidence, to be specially sensory in function. Extending
  from this area in the sagittal plane there are two strips of ciliated epithelium called the "polar
  fields."</p>

  <p>The aboral sense-organ of the Ctenophora is one of the most characteristic organs of the
  Phylum. The aboral pole of the Medusae of Coelenterata is usually devoid of any special
  modification of the ectoderm of the bell, and in the Tiarid genus <i>Stomatoca</i> the little
  tassel at the aboral pole of the Medusa cannot in any sense be regarded as a homologue of the
  sense-organ of the Ctenophore. If the aboral sense-organ of the Ctenophora can be compared with
  that of any other group of animals, it would be with the statocyst of many of the Turbellaria,
  such as that of <i>Convoluta</i>, but it is far more satisfactory to regard it as an organ
  peculiar to the Ctenophora and as having no true relationship with any sense-organ found in other
  animals.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;The mouth of the Cydippiform Ctenophores opens into a sac-like
  chamber called the "stomodaeum," flattened in the sagittal plane and stretching from the oral pole
  as far as the centre of the body. The stomodaeum passes into a chamber flattened in the transverse
  plane called the "infundibulum." From the infundibulum a narrow tube passes in the direction of
  the aboral pole called the "intestine," and from the extremity of this four short tubes pass to
  the sides of the polar fields at the place where these fields join the sensory area. Two, or, in
  some cases, all four of these tubes open to the exterior; but they do not appear to serve the
  purpose of ejecting the undigested portions of the food, which usually pass to the exterior by the
  mouth as in Coelenterata and Turbellaria.</p>

  <p>From the lateral extremities of the infundibulum four pairs of tubes pass to the equatorial
  region of the body, where each one joins a longitudinal vessel which runs immediately beneath the
  epithelium supporting the ribs. These are called the longitudinal or "sub-costal" canals. From the
  infundibulum there also <span class="pagenum" id="page416"><span
  class="smaller">{416}</span></span>passes a single pair of blind canals, the "paragastric canals,"
  one on each side of the stomodaeum, to end in the oral cone.</p>

  <p>In the Lobata the paragastric canals communicate with the longitudinal canals under the
  transverse costae,<a id="NtA_429" href="#Nt_429"><sup>[429]</sup></a> and send long blind
  processes into the lobes. In the Cestoidea the arrangement of the canals is considerably modified
  in adaptation to the needs of the ribbon-like body. In the Beroidae the paragastric and
  longitudinal canals are in communication by a peripheral network of canals, and in the Platyctenea
  there is also a network of canals but without any definite longitudinal vessels.</p>

  <p><b>Sexual Organs.</b>&mdash;Most of the Ctenophora are undoubtedly hermaphrodite, but Willey
  was unable to find ova in some of his specimens of <i>Ctenoplana</i> that were producing
  spermatozoa. In the Cydippidea the ova are produced on one side of the longitudinal canal and the
  spermatozoa on the other. Each longitudinal canal therefore performs the functions of a
  hermaphrodite gland. When the sexual cells are ripe they escape into the infundibulum and are
  discharged by the mouth. In <i>Ctenoplana</i> there are definite and direct male genital
  ducts.</p>

  <p>The ova are very small when discharged and undergo complete segmentation in the sea water. The
  development of the Cydippidea is really direct, but there is a stage passed through in which the
  tentacles are relatively very prominent and situated close to the aboral pole, and this stage is
  very different in appearance from the adult. In the Lobata and Cestoidea there is, however, a
  definite larval stage, of the general appearance of a <i>Mertensia</i>, and during this stage
  fertile eggs and spermatozoa are formed and set free.</p>

  <p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Ctenophora are found at the surface of nearly all seas, and many of
  the genera have a cosmopolitan distribution. Some of the Lobata, the Cestoidea, and the
  Platyctenea are more commonly found in the warmer regions of the world. <i>Pleurobrachia
  pileus</i>, <i>Bolina infundibulum</i>, <i>Beroe ovata</i>, and <i>B. cucumis</i> occur off the
  British coast.</p>

  <p>Most of the Ctenophora are from 5 to 20 mm. in diameter, but <i>Beroe</i> reaches the length of
  90 mm., <i>Eucharis multicornis</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page417"><span
  class="smaller">{417}</span></span>a height of 250 mm., and <i>Cestus veneris</i> has been found
  no less than 1&frac12; metres from one extremity to the other.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Ctenophores usually go about in shoals, and in the case of <i>Beroe cucumis</i> and
  <i>Eucharis multicornis</i> the shoals may be of very great extent. <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i> of
  the British coasts is often found at the end of the season (July) as a series of isolated
  individuals; but in June they occur in small shoals, swimming so close together that they will
  choke a tow-net in a very short space of time.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS I. TENTACULATA</p>

  <p class="sp3">Ctenophora provided with a pair of tentacles in the larval stages only or in both
  larval and adult stages.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Cydippidea.</b></p>

  <p>This order includes a number of spherical or oval Ctenophores, with a pair of tentacles
  retractile into deep tentacular pits in the adult stage.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Mertensiidae.</b>&mdash;The body is compressed in the transverse plane, and the ribs
  on the transverse areas are longer than those on the sagittal areas. The family includes the genus
  <i>Euchlora</i>, which occurs in the Mediterranean and in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean.
  In <i>Charistephane</i> there are only two enormous ctenophoral plates in each of the longitudinal
  tracts. These plates are so broad that they almost meet laterally to form two continuous circlets
  round the body of the animal. This genus is found in the Mediterranean, but a few specimens have
  also been obtained in the Atlantic.</p>

  <p>In <i>Tinerfe</i> the body is almost cylindrical, and there is a pair of kidney-shaped
  swellings at the sides of the aboral pole. It has a pale blue colour, and is found in the Guinea
  and south equatorial currents of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

  <p>The name <i>Mertensia</i> has been given to several forms that are undoubtedly the young stages
  of genera belonging to the Lobata, but Chun retains the name <i>M. ovum</i> for a species which is
  very abundant in the Arctic currents of the North Atlantic.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Callianiridae.</b>&mdash;Two or four wing-like processes, into <span class="pagenum"
  id="page418"><span class="smaller">{418}</span></span>which the longitudinal canals extend, are
  found at the aboral pole. <i>Callianira</i> has two of these processes arranged in the transverse
  plane, and <i>Lophoctenia</i> has four. <i>Callianira</i> is found in the Mediterranean and in the
  Atlantic from the Arctic to the Antarctic waters.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Pleurobrachiidae.</b>&mdash;The body is almost spherical in form, and the eight ribs
  are equal in length.</p>

  <p>This family includes the genus <i>Pleurobrachia</i>, in which the ribs extend for a
  considerable distance along the lines of longitude of the spherical body, but do not reach either
  the oral or the aboral areas. <i>P. pileus</i> is the commonest British Ctenophore, and may be
  found in shoals in May, June, and July at the surface of the sea or cast up on the sand as the
  tide ebbs. It is widely distributed in the North Atlantic waters. <i>P. rhodopis</i> of the
  Mediterranean has rather shorter ribs than <i>P. pileus</i>. Two new species have recently been
  described from the Malay Archipelago.<a id="NtA_430" href="#Nt_430"><sup>[430]</sup></a>
  <i>Hormiphora</i> (Fig. 180, p. <a href="#page413">413</a>) differs from <i>Pleurobrachia</i> in
  having much shorter ribs, and in possessing two kinds of pinnae on the tentacles, those of the
  ordinary kind and others much larger and sometimes palmate in character. This genus has a
  world-wide distribution.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In <i>Lampetia</i> and <i>Euplokamis</i> the body is more cylindrical in shape than
  it is in the other genera, but the ribs and subjacent longitudinal canals extend up to the margin
  of the aboral field. Both these genera occur in the Mediterranean, but <i>Lampetia</i> is also
  found in the Malay Archipelago.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Lobata.</b></p>

  <p>The body is considerably flattened in the transverse plane, and the sagittal areas are extended
  into the form of two wide peristomial lobes. The oral ends of the areas between the transverse and
  sagittal ribs are extended to form four flaps, called the "auricles." There are no tentacles nor
  tentacle-sheaths of the ordinary kind in the adult form; but numerous tentilla, similar in some
  respects to the pinnae of the tentacles of other Ctenophora, form a fringe round the margin of the
  auricles and the peristome. A single pair of long, filamentous, non-retractile tentacles arise
  from the sides of the peristomium in <i>Eucharis <span class="pagenum" id="page419"><span
  class="smaller">{419}</span></span>multicornis</i>. These tentacles have no sheaths, and do not
  bear pinnae. They are probably not homologous with those of other Ctenophora.</p>

  <p>The characters that separate the families of Lobata are chiefly those of varying size, shape,
  and position of the peristomial lobes and auricles. In the Lesueuriidae the peristomial lobes are
  rudimentary; in the other families they are moderately or very large. In the Bolinidae the
  auricles are short, but in most of the other families they are long and ribbon-like. In
  <i>Eucharis</i> they can be spirally twisted in repose.</p>

  <p>The modifications of the external form seen in the Lobata are accompanied by some modifications
  of the internal structure. Among these, perhaps the most interesting is a communication between
  the transverse longitudinal and the paragastric canals, and the long convoluted tubes given off to
  the peristomial lobes by the sagittal longitudinal canals. Very little is known about the
  life-history and development of most of the Lobata, but Chun has shown that in <i>Eucharis</i> and
  <i>Bolina</i> there is a Cydippiform larval stage which produces ripe ova and spermatozoa. This is
  followed by a period of sterility, but when the adult characters are developed they become again
  sexually mature. To this series of sexual phenomena the name "Dissogony" is given.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="sp3">Most of these Ctenophores occur in the warm and tropical seas; but <i>Bolina</i> is
  found occasionally at Plymouth in the month of May, on the west coast of Ireland, and at other
  stations on the British coasts. <i>Eucharis</i> is regarded as one of the most beautiful of the
  Phylum. A swarm, some miles in length, of large specimens of <i>E. multicornis</i> was met by the
  Plankton Expedition in the south equatorial current of the Atlantic during the month of
  September.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order III. Cestoidea.</b></p>

  <p>In this order the body is so much compressed in the transverse plane and elongated in the
  sagittal plane that it assumes the shape of a long narrow band or ribbon. The tentacular sheaths
  are present but the tentacles are degenerate in the adult. The tentacular functions are performed
  by numerous tentilla situated in long grooves extending along the whole length of the oral side of
  the band-like body. The transverse ribs are reduced; the sagittal ribs extend along the whole of
  the aboral side.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. Cestidae.</b>&mdash;This is the only family of the order. <i>Cestus veneris</i>, the
  Venus's girdle of the Mediterranean Sea, is also found in the Atlantic Ocean, and specimens
  belonging to the same genus, but probably to a different species, occur as far north as the White
  Sea. Some of the larger specimens are considerably over 1 metre in length.</p>

  orange patch at each end of the body. It is said to be extremely graceful in the water, moving
  with slow, ribbon-like undulations, and shining in the sunlight with a violet iridescence.
  <i>Vexillum</i>, from the Mediterranean Sea and Canary Islands, is rather more pointed at the
  extremities than <i>Cestus</i>, and differs from it in some important anatomical characters.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order IV. Platyctenea.</b></p>

  <p>This order has been constituted for two remarkable genera, in which the oro-apical axis is so
  much reduced that distinct dorsal and ventral surfaces can be distinguished.</p>

  <p>There is a single pair of long milky-white tentacles capable of complete retraction into
  tentacular sheaths.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Ctenoplanidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Ctenoplana</i> was discovered by Korotneff in 1886
  floating with the Plankton off the coast of Sumatra. In 1896 Willey <a id="NtA_432"
  href="#Nt_432"><sup>[432]</sup></a> discovered four specimens on a cuttle-bone floating off the
  coast of New Guinea. To these authors we are indebted for the only accounts of this animal that
  have been published.</p>

  <p>When the <i>Ctenoplana</i> is creeping on the bottom of a dish or with its dorsal side
  downwards on the surface film of the water, it has the form of a flattened disc with a notch on
  each side. On the upper or dorsal surface eight short rows of ctenophoral plates may be seen, and
  in a position corresponding with the two notches in the margin of the body are situated the two
  sheaths from which the long pinnate tentacles protrude. In the exact centre of the dorsal surface
  is situated the statolith, supported by stiff processes from adjacent cells; and forming a circlet
  round the statolith there is a row of short ciliated tentacles. These tentacles, however, when
  examined carefully in the living animal, are found to be arranged in two sets of about nine in
  each, separated by narrow gaps on each side, the gaps corresponding in position with the axis
  through the tentacles.</p>

  <p>When the animal is swimming it assumes a helmet-shape by depressing the sides of the body like
  a pair of flaps on the tentacular axis, and then the ctenophoral plates come into play and produce
  the progressive movements of the animals. The pinnate tentacles are opaque white in colour, and
  have peculiar serpentine <span class="pagenum" id="page422"><span
  class="smaller">{422}</span></span>movements. Very little is known at present concerning many
  details of the internal anatomy, but there is one point of considerable theoretical
  interest&mdash;namely, the presence of definite male genital ducts.</p>

  <p>Three of Dr. Willey's specimens were mottled with a green pigment, whereas his fourth specimen
  and Korotneff's only specimen were mottled with a red pigment. It has yet to be determined whether
  the differences which have been observed in the individual specimens are of specific value.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Coeloplanidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Coeloplana</i> was originally discovered by Kowalevsky
  in the Red Sea, but has recently been found by Abbott <a id="NtA_433"
  href="#Nt_433"><sup>[433]</sup></a> on the coast of Japan.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Japanese species are found principally on encrusting Algae, <i>Zostera</i>,
  <i>Melobesia</i>, etc., which they resemble very closely in colour. The Red Sea species is,
  according to Kowalevsky, ciliated all over, but the Japanese species are ciliated only on the
  ventral surface. As in <i>Ctenoplana</i>, the body of <i>Coeloplana</i> is a flattened disc with a
  notch at each end of the tentacular axis, when creeping; but <i>Coeloplana</i> does not swim, nor
  at any time does it assume a helmet-shape. The tentacles are very long and of a chalky-white
  colour. They can be retracted into tentacle-sheaths. When the animal is excited it throws out the
  whole tentacle in a cloud of white filaments, "and to watch it at such a time, shooting out and
  retracting the tentacles, moving along the side of the aquarium like a battleship in action is
  truly a remarkable spectacle."<a id="NtA_434" href="#Nt_434"><sup>[434]</sup></a> On the dorsal

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. Beroidae.</b>&mdash;<i>Beroe</i>, the only genus of this family and class,
  differs from other Ctenophora in several important particulars. There are no tentacles, and the
  stomodaeum is so large that the body-form assumes that of a thimble with moderately thick walls.
  The infundibulum is small. The paragastric and longitudinal canals give rise to numerous
  ramifications which form a network distributed throughout the surface of the body. The statolith
  is unprotected by a dome, and the polar fields are bordered by a number of small branching
  papillae. The eight ribs extend for nearly the whole length of the body. <i>Beroe</i> is almost
  cosmopolitan, and is frequently found at the surface of the sea in great numbers. <i>B. ovata</i>
  is found off the Shetlands, Hebrides, and west coast of Ireland, but is rare on the east coast of
  the British Islands and in the English Channel. At Valencia it is common in August and September,
  and sometimes reaches the great size of 90 mm. in length by 50 mm. in breadth. It is usually of a
  pale pink colour.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><span class="sc">Appendix to Ctenophora</span></p>

  <p><i>Hydroctena salenskii</i> has recently been discovered by Dawydoff<a id="NtA_435"
  href="#Nt_435"><sup>[435]</sup></a> floating with the Plankton off the island Saparua in the Malay
  Archipelago. It is claimed to be a connecting link between the Ctenophora and the Medusae of the
  Hydrozoa.</p>

  <p>In external features it is like one of the Narcomedusae, having a transparent jelly-like bell
  with a wide bell-mouth guarded by a velum (Fig. 184, <i>V</i>). There are only two simple but
  solid tentacles (<i>t</i>), provided with tentacle-sheaths, but inserted on opposite sides of the
  bell&mdash;not on the margin, but, as in the Ctenophore, at a level not far removed from the
  aboral pole. At the aboral pole there is a minute pore surrounded by a high ciliated epithelium
  bearing an orange pigment. This leads into <span class="pagenum" id="page424"><span
  class="smaller">{424}</span></span>a short blind canal, which terminates in an ampulla bearing two
  statoliths supported by elastic processes from the ampullar epithelium.</p>

  <p>The sub-umbrellar cavity extends for a distance of about one-half the height of the bell. The
  mouth (<i>M</i>), which opens into this cavity, leads into a wide cavity that gives off a short
  blind canal to the side of each tentacular sheath, and a straight tube that leads straight to the
  statocyst, where it also ends blindly. There are no radial canals and no ring canal at the margin
  of the umbrella. There are also no ctenophoral plates. In the absence of any information
  concerning the position of the genital glands, the character of the epithelium of the tentacles
  and the development, we are not justified in regarding <i>Hydroctena</i> either as a Ctenophore or
  as a connecting link between the Ctenophora and the Hydromedusae. It may be regarded simply as a
  Craspedote Medusa, probably related to the Narcomedusae, with a remarkable aberrant aboral
  sense-organ.</p>

  class="smaller">ECHINODERMATA&mdash;INTRODUCTION&mdash;CLASSIFICATION&mdash;ANATOMY OF A
  STARFISH&mdash;SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT OF ASTEROIDEA</span></p>

  <p>The name Echinodermata<a id="NtA_436" href="#Nt_436"><sup>[436]</sup></a> means literally
  "spiny-skinned," and thus brings into prominence one very conspicuous feature of most of the
  animals belonging to this phylum. All, it is true, do not possess spines; but with one or two
  doubtful exceptions, all have calcareous plates embedded in the skin, and these plates, in many
  cases, push out projections which raise the skin into corresponding elevations, which are called
  the spines. The spines are, like the other plates, inside the skin, and to speak of an Echinoderm
  living in its shell, as we speak of a Snail, is a serious error. The shell of a Mollusc is
  fundamentally a secretion poured forth from the skin, and is thus entirely external to the real
  living parts; but the plates and spines of an Echinoderm may be compared to our own bones, which
  are embedded deeply in the flesh. Hence the name <i>ossicle</i> (little bone) is used to designate
  these organs.</p>

  <p>Besides the possession of these spines, Echinoderms are characterised by having their
  organisation pervaded by a fundamental radial symmetry. The principal organs of the body are
  repeated and are arranged like the spokes of a wheel round a central axis instead of being, as,
  for example, in Chaetopoda, arranged behind one another in longitudinal series.</p>

  <p>In addition to these striking peculiarities, Echinoderms possess a most interesting internal
  organisation, being in this respect almost exactly intermediate between the Coelenterata <span
  class="pagenum" id="page428"><span class="smaller">{428}</span></span>and the higher Invertebrata.
  Like so many of the latter, the Echinodermata have an anus, that is, a second opening to the
  alimentary canal through which indigestible material is rejected; like them also, they have a
  body-cavity or coelom surrounding the alimentary canal&mdash;from the lining of which the genital
  cells are developed. On the other hand, there is no definite circulatory system, nor any
  specialised excretory organ, and the nervous system exhibits no concentration which could be
  called a brain, and is, moreover, in close connexion with the skin. In all these points the
  Echinodermata resemble the Coelenterata.</p>

  <p>One of the most characteristic features of the internal anatomy of Echinodermata is the
  presence of a peculiar series of organs, known collectively as the water-vascular system or
  <b>hydrocoel</b>. This is really a special division of the coelom or body-cavity which takes on
  the form of a ring-shaped canal embracing the mouth, from which are given off long radial canals,
  usually five in number, running to the more peripheral parts of the body.<a id="NtA_437"
  href="#Nt_437"><sup>[437]</sup></a> Each radial canal carries a double series of lateral branches,
  which push out the skin so as to appear as appendages of the body. These appendages are known as
  tentacles or tube-feet; they are both sensory and respiratory in function, and often in addition,
  as the name <b>tube-foot</b> indicates, assist in locomotion. As a general term for these
  appendages, to be applied in all cases without reference to their function, the name <b>podium</b>
  has been suggested and will be employed here. A system of canals, in many ways resembling the
  water-vascular system, is found in Brachiopoda, Gephyrea and Polyzoa, but the peculiarity of
  Echinodermata is the way in which it is kept filled with fluid. From the ring-canal in the
  interval (or <b>interradius</b>) between two radial canals, a vertical canal, termed the
  <b>stone-canal</b>, is given off, which communicates with the exterior by means of a sieve-like
  plate, the <b>madreporite</b>, pierced by fine canals. These canals and the stone-canal itself are
  lined with powerful cilia, which produce a strong inward current, and keep the water-vascular
  system tensely filled with sea water.</p>

  <p>The phylum includes the familiar Starfish and Sea-urchins, which in sheltered spots are found
  between tide-marks; the <span class="pagenum" id="page429"><span
  class="smaller">{429}</span></span>Brittle Stars and Sea-cucumbers, which can be dredged up from
  below low-water mark, and lastly the beautiful Feather-stars, of which there are comparatively few
  species still living, although huge beds of limestone are composed of the remains of fossil
  Feather-stars.</p>

  <p>One species of Sea-cucumber (<i>Synapta similis</i>)<a id="NtA_438"
  href="#Nt_438"><sup>[438]</sup></a> is said to enter brackish water in the mangrove swamps of the
  tropics; but, with this exception, the whole phylum is marine. A few species can endure partial
  exposure to the air when left bare by the receding tide, but the overwhelming majority are only
  found beneath low-water mark, and a considerable number live in the deepest recesses of the
  ocean.</p>

  <p>Their distribution is, no doubt, partly determined by food, a number of species being strictly
  confined to the neighbourhood of the shore. On the other hand, since a very large number of
  species live on the layer of mud impregnated with animal remains which forms the superficial layer
  of the deposit covering the sea-floor, it is not surprising to learn that many have an exceedingly
  wide range, since this deposit is very widely distributed. Another equally important factor in
  determining distribution is wave-disturbance, and it is surprising to learn to what a depth this
  extends. Off the west coast of Ireland a large wave literally breaks on a submerged rock 15
  fathoms beneath the surface. Speaking generally, it is useless to look for Echinoderms on an
  exposed coast, and the same species, which in the sheltered waters of the Clyde are exposed at low
  water, must be dredged up from 20 to 30 fathoms outside Plymouth Sound.</p>

  <p>The ordinary collector is attracted to the group chiefly by the regularity and beauty of the
  patterns produced by the radial symmetry, but to the scientific zoologist they are interesting
  from many other points of view. Differing widely nevertheless from the higher Invertebrata in
  their symmetry when adult, they have as larvae a marked bilateral symmetry, and the secondary
  development of the radial symmetry constitutes one of the most remarkable life-histories known in
  the animal kingdom.</p>

  <p>Then again, owing to the possession of ossicles, the Echinodermata are one of the few groups of
  Invertebrata of which abundant remains occur fossilised. In attempting, therefore, to <span
  class="pagenum" id="page430"><span class="smaller">{430}</span></span>decipher the past history of
  life from the fossil record, it is necessary to have an exact and detailed knowledge of Echinoderm
  skeletons and their relation to the soft parts. Lastly, the internal organisation of Echinoderms
  throws valuable light on the origin of the complicated systems of organs found in the higher
  animals.</p>

  <p>Echinodermata are divided into two great sub-phyla, which must have very early diverged from
  one another. These are<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p>(1) Eleutherozoa,</p>
    <p>(2) Pelmatozoa.<a id="NtA_439" href="#Nt_439"><sup>[439]</sup></a></p>
  </div>

  <p class="sp3">The sub-phylum <b>Pelmatozoa</b>, to which the living Feather-stars
  (<b>Crinoidea</b>) and the majority of the known fossil species belong, is characterised by the
  possession of a fixing organ placed in the centre of the surface opposite the mouth&mdash;the
  aboral surface as it is called. Ordinarily this organ takes on the form of a jointed stalk, but in
  most modern species it is a little knob with a tuft of rooting processes, termed cirri. In the
  other sub-phylum, the <b>Eleutherozoa</b>, no such organ is found, and the animals wander about
  freely during their adult life, though for a brief period of their larval existence they may be
  fixed by a stalk-like protuberance arising from the <i>oral</i> surface.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">SUB-PHYLUM I. ELEUTHEROZOA</p>

  <p>The <b>Eleutherozoa</b> are divided into four main classes, between which no intermediate forms
  are found amongst the living species, though intermediate types have been found fossil.</p>

  <p>The four classes into which the Eleutherozoa are divided are defined as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(1) <b>Asteroidea</b> (Starfish).&mdash;"Star"-shaped or pentagonal Eleutherozoa with five or
  more triangular arms, not sharply marked off from the central disc. The mouth is in the centre of
  one surface, called from this circumstance the "oral"; the anus is in the centre of the opposite
  surface, termed the "aboral." From the mouth a groove runs out on the under surface of each <span
  class="pagenum" id="page431"><span class="smaller">{431}</span></span>arm towards its tip, termed
  the "ambulacral" groove. Projecting from the ambulacral groove are found the podia or tube-feet,
  the organs of movement and sensation of the animal.</p>

  <p>(2) <b>Ophiuroidea</b> (Brittle Stars).&mdash;Eleutherozoa, in which the body consists of a
  round disc with long worm-like arms inserted in grooves on its under surface. No anus is present,
  and the ambulacral grooves are represented by closed canals. The podia are merely sensory and
  respiratory, locomotion being effected by muscular jerks of the arms.</p>

  <p>(3) <b>Echinoidea</b> (Sea-urchins).&mdash;Globular or disc-shaped Eleutherozoa, in which the
  skeleton forms a compact cuirass except for a short distance round the mouth (peristome) and round
  the anus (periproct).  The ambulacral grooves are represented by canals which, like meridians of
  longitude on a school-globe, run from the neighbourhood of the mouth to near the aboral pole of
  the body. The spines are large and movably articulated with the plates. The animals move by means
  of podia and spines, or by means of the latter only. The anus is usually situated at the aboral
  pole, but is sometimes displaced towards the side, or even on to the ventral surface.</p>

  <p class="sp3">(4) <b>Holothuroidea</b> (Sea-cucumbers).&mdash;Sausage-shaped Eleutherozoa, in
  which the skeleton is represented only by isolated nodules of calcium carbonate, and in which the
  body-wall is highly muscular. The mouth and anus are situated at opposite ends of the body, and
  the ambulacral grooves (represented by closed canals) run from near the mouth to the proximity of
  the anus. Movement is accomplished by means of the podia, aided by worm-like contractions of the
  body.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS I. ASTEROIDEA<a id="NtA_440"
  href="#Nt_440"><sup>[440]</sup></a> (<span class="sc">Starfish</span>)</p>

  <p>The Starfish derive their name from their resemblance in shape to the conventional image of a
  star. The body consists of broad triangular arms (generally five in number) which coalesce in the
  centre to form a disc. The skin is soft and <span class="pagenum" id="page432"><span
  class="smaller">{432}</span></span>semi-transparent, permitting the skeleton to be easily
  detected; this consists of a mesh-work of rods or plates, leaving between them intervals of soft
  skin. In a living Starfish it can be seen that many of these soft places are raised up into
  finger-like outgrowths, which are termed "papulae" or "dermal gills," through the thin walls of
  which an active interchange of gases with the surrounding water takes place, and the animal
  obtains in this way the oxygen necessary for its respiration.</p>

  <p>Very few and feeble muscle-fibres exist in the body-wall, and the movements of the arms, as a
  whole, are very slow and limited in range. There is a membranous lip surrounding the mouth, from
  which five broad grooves run outwards, one on the underside of each arm. These are termed the
  "ambulacral grooves." Each groove is <span title="L" class="fsn">&Lambda;</span>-shaped, and its
  sides are stiffened by a series of rod-like ossicles called the "ambulacral ossicles."</p>

  <p>The animal progresses by the aid of a large number of translucent tentacles, termed "tube-feet"
  or "podia," which are attached to the walls of the ambulacral grooves.</p>

  <p><b>Anatomy of a Starfish.</b>&mdash;As an introduction to the study of the anatomy not only of
  Starfish but of Echinodermata as a whole, we select <i>Asterias rubens</i>, the common Starfish of
  the British coasts, which in many places may be found on the beach near low-water mark.</p>

  <p><b>External Features.</b>&mdash;In this species (Fig. 185) the skeleton is a net-work of
  rod-like plates, leaving wide meshes between them, through which protrude a perfect forest of
  transparent papulae. From the points of junction of the rods arise short blunt spines surrounded
  by thick cushions of skin. The surfaces of these cushions are covered with a multitude of whitish
  specks, which, on closer inspection, are seen to have the form of minute pincers, each consisting
  of two movable blades crossing each other below and articulated to a basal piece. These peculiar
  organs are termed "pedicellariae" (Fig. 186), and their function is to keep the animal clean by
  seizing hold of any minute organisms which would attempt to settle on the soft and delicate skin.
  When irritated the blades open and then snap together violently, and remain closed for a long
  time.<a id="NtA_441" href="#Nt_441"><sup>[441]</sup></a> These actions are brought about by
  appropriate muscles attaching the blades to the basal piece.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page433"><span class="smaller">{433}</span></span></div>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

      aboral surface, &times; 1. <i>mad</i>, Madreporite.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The last-named ossicle increases the certainty of the grip by fixing the lower parts of each
  blade in the same vertical plane, and preventing lateral slipping, so that it serves the same
  purpose as the pivot in a pair of scissors. Each blade, in fact, fits into a groove on the side of
  this piece. The muscles which close the blades arise from the lower ends (handles) of the blades,
  and are united below to form a common muscular string which attaches the whole organ to one of the
  plates of the skeleton. An attempt of the victim to tear the pedicellaria out is resisted by the
  contraction of this string, which thus brings about a closer grip of the blades. In order that the
  blades may open they must first be lifted out of the grooves on the basal piece&mdash;this is
  effected by special lifting muscles. The opening is <span class="pagenum" id="page434"><span
  class="smaller">{434}</span></span>brought about by muscles extending from the "handle" of one
  blade to the upper part of the other.</p>

  <p>Scattered about amongst the papulae between the cushions are other pedicellariae of a larger
  size in which the blades do not cross one another (Fig. 186, B).</p>

  <p>In the space or "interradius" between two arms, on the aboral surface, there is found a
  button-shaped ossicle. This is covered with fine grooves, and from a fancied resemblance between
  it and some forms of coral it has received the name "madreporite" (Fig. 185, <i>mad</i>). The
  bottoms of the grooves are perforated by capillary canals lined by flagella, through the action of
  which water is constantly being introduced into the water-vascular system.</p>

  <p>The anus is situated near the centre of the upper surface of the disc, but it is so minute as
  to require careful inspection in order to discover its position (Fig. 185).</p>

  <p>On the under side of the animal the most conspicuous features are the five ambulacral grooves
  which radiate out from the "peristome," a thin membranous area surrounding the central mouth. The
  grooves are filled with the tube-feet, which are closely crowded together and apparently arranged
  in four rows.</p>

  <p><b>Skeleton.</b>&mdash;The sides of the ambulacral grooves are stiffened by the rod-like
  "ambulacral ossicles." To the outer ends of these are articulated a set of shorter rods termed the
  "adambulacral ossicles" which carry each two or three rod-like spines, the "adambulacral spines,"
  the skin covering which bears numerous pedicellariae (Fig. 187, B). When the animal is irritated
  the edges of the groove are brought together, and these <span class="pagenum" id="page435"><span
  class="smaller">{435}</span></span>spines then form a trellis-work covering and protecting the
  delicate tube-feet; the numerous pedicellariae are then in a position to make it unpleasant for
  any intruder. The closure of the groove is effected by means of powerful muscles connecting each
  ambulacral ossicle with its fellow. There are also feebler muscles connecting these plates with
  their successors and predecessors, which enable the arm to be bent downwards in a vertical plane.
  It is raised by a muscular band running along the dorsal wall of the coelom to the point of the
  arm.</p>

  <p>When the series of ambulacral and adambulacral ossicles is followed inwards towards the mouth
  it is seen that the first ambulacral ossicle is closely fixed to the second, but is widely <span
  class="pagenum" id="page436"><span class="smaller">{436}</span></span>separated from its fellow,
  remaining, however, connected with the latter by a powerful adductor muscle. In consequence of the
  separation of this pair of ossicles each is brought into closer contact with the corresponding
  ossicle in the adjacent radius, to which it is connected by a muscle called the abductor. The
  first adambulacrals in adjacent radii are also brought into closer contact and carry long spines
  which, when the ambulacral grooves are contracted, project like a grating over the mouth. In the
  order of Asteroidea to which <i>Asterias</i> belongs, the adambulacrals themselves do not project
  much, but in all other cases they form prominent mouth-angles, so that the opening of the mouth
  becomes star-shaped (Fig. 211, p. <a href="#page483">483</a>).</p>

  <p>Except in the case of the ambulacral and adambulacral plates little regular arrangement is to
  be detected in the ossicles of the skeleton which, as has already been mentioned, form a
  mesh-work. If, however, the arm be cut open and viewed from the inside it will be seen that the
  edge is strengthened above and below by very thick, powerful, rod-like plates. These are called
  the "supero-marginal" and "infero-marginal" ossicles; they are not visible from the outside, since
  they are covered by a thick layer of the body-wall containing other smaller plates (Fig. 190,
  <i>marg</i>). In many genera, however, they are exposed, and form a conspicuous edging to the arm
  above and below. In many genera, also, there are three conspicuous series of plates on the back of
  each arm, viz. a median row, called "carinals" (<i>car.</i>, Fig. 191), and two lateral rows,
  termed "dorso-laterals" (<i>d.lat.</i>, Fig. 191). These three rows, with the two rows of
  marginals, one of ambulacrals, and one of adambulacrals on each side (11 rows in all), constitute
  the primitive skeleton of the arm, and appear first in development.</p>

  <p>The structure of all these elements of the skeleton is the same. They may be described as
  scaffoldings of carbonate of lime, interpenetrated by a mesh-work of cells fused with one another,
  by which the carbonate of lime has been deposited. The matrix in which the ossicles lie is a
  jelly-like substance traversed by a few bands of fibres which connect the various rods with one
  another. This jelly is almost fluid in the fresh state, but when heated forms a hard compound,
  possibly allied to mucin, which will turn the edge of a razor.</p>

  <p>When the covering of the back is dissected off the <b>coelom</b> is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page437"><span class="smaller">{437}</span></span>opened. This is a spacious cavity which
  apparently surrounds the alimentary canal and extends into the arms. It has, however, its own
  proper wall, which is called the "peritoneum," both on the outer side, where it abuts on the skin,
  and on the inner side, where it comes in contact with the wall of the alimentary canal. The outer
  wall is called the "somatic peritoneum," and it is possible to dissect off the rest of the
  body-wall and leave it intact; the inner wall, from its close association with the alimentary
  canal, is termed the "splanchnic peritoneum." This wall can only be distinguished in microscopic
  sections from that of the alimentary canal, to which it is closely applied.</p>

  <p>The coelom is filled with a fluid, which is practically sea water with a little albuminous
  matter in solution. Through the thin walls of the papulae oxygen passes into this fluid, whence it
  easily reaches the inner organs, since they are all in contact with some part of the coelomic
  wall. Similarly CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed by the coelomic fluid from all parts of the body, and
  diffuses through the papulae to the surrounding water.</p>

  <p>The Starfish possesses no definite <b>kidney</b> for getting rid of nitrogenous waste. In most
  of the higher animals with a well-developed coelom it has been proved that the kidney is simply a
  specialised portion of the coelom, and in many cases some parts of the coelomic wall still retain
  their excretory functions, which apparently the whole originally possessed. In the Starfish and in
  Echinodermata generally this primitive state of affairs is still retained. From the cells forming
  the coelomic wall, cells are budded off into the fluid, where they swim about. These cells from
  their movements are called amoebocytes. If a substance such as indigo-carmine, which when
  introduced into the tissues of the higher animals is eliminated by the kidney, is injected into
  the Starfish, it is found soon after to be vigorously absorbed by the amoebocytes. These later
  accumulate in the dermal branchiae, through the thin walls of which they make their way<a
  id="NtA_442" href="#Nt_442"><sup>[442]</sup></a> to the outside, where they degenerate.</p>

  <p>The coelom is indented by five folds, which project inwards from the interradii. These folds
  are called the "interradial septa"; they are stiffened by a calcareous deposit, which is not,
  however, sufficiently dense to constitute a plate. In one of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page438"><span class="smaller">{438}</span></span>septa the axial sinus and stone-canal (see
  below) are embedded. These septa are to be regarded as areas of lateral adhesion between the
  arms.</p>

  <p>The <b>alimentary canal</b> consists of several distinct portions. The mouth leads by a narrow
  neck called the "oesophagus" into a voluminous baggy sac termed the "stomach," which is produced
  into ten short pouches, two projecting into each arm. The stomach leads in turn by a wide opening
  into a pentagonal flattened sac, the "pyloric sac," which lies above it. Each angle of the pyloric
  sac is prolonged into a tube&mdash;the so-called "pyloric duct"&mdash;running out into the arm,
  where it immediately bifurcates into two forks, each beset by a large number of small pouches
  <span class="pagenum" id="page439"><span class="smaller">{439}</span></span>and attached to the
  dorsal wall of the coelom by suspensory bands of membrane called mesenteries. These ten forks are
  called "pyloric caeca"; they are of a deep green colour owing to the pigment in their wall. Beyond
  the pyloric sac the alimentary canal is continued as the slender "rectum" to the anus. The rectum
  gives off two small branched pouches of a brown colour called "rectal caeca." This comparatively
  complicated form of alimentary canal is related to the nature of the food of the animal and the
  method it employs to capture its prey.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 189.</span>&mdash;View of a Starfish (<i>Echinaster</i>)
      devouring a Mussel. 1. The madreporite.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The favourite <b>food</b><a id="NtA_443" href="#Nt_443"><sup>[443]</sup></a> of <i>Asterias</i>
  consists of the common bivalves of the coast, notably of the Mussel (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>). There
  is, however, no animal which it will not attack if it is fortunate enough to be able to catch it.
  The Starfish seizes its prey by the tube-feet, and places it directly under its mouth, folding its
  arms down over it in umbrella fashion. The muscles which run around the arms and disc in the
  body-wall contract, and the pressure thus brought to bear on the incompressible fluid contained in
  the coelom, forces out the thin membranous peristome and partially turns the stomach inside out.
  The everted edge of the stomach is wrapped round the prey.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page440"><span class="smaller">{440}</span></span></div>

  <p>Soon the bivalve is forced to relax its muscles and allow the valves to gape. The edge of the
  stomach is then inserted between the valves and applied directly to the soft parts of the prey
  which is thus completely digested. When the Starfish moves away nothing but the cleaned shell is
  left behind. If the bivalve is small it may be completely taken into the stomach, and the empty
  shell later rejected through the mouth.</p>

  <p>It was for a long time a puzzle in what way the bivalve was forced to open. Schiemenz<a
  id="NtA_444" href="#Nt_444"><sup>[444]</sup></a> has, however, shown that when the Starfish folds
  itself in umbrella-like form over the prey it holds on to the substratum by means of the tube-feet
  of the distal portions of the arms, whilst, by means of the tube-feet belonging to the central
  portions, it drags apart the valves by main force. He has shown experimentally: (1) that whilst a
  bivalve may be able to resist a sudden pull of 4000 grammes it will yield to a pull of 900 grammes
  long continued; (2) that a Starfish can exert a pull of 1350 grammes; (3) that a Starfish is
  unable to open a bivalve unless it be allowed to raise itself into a hump, so that the pull of the
  central tube-feet is at right angles to the prey. A Starfish confined between two glass plates
  walked about all day carrying with it a bivalve which it was unable to open.</p>

  <p>The lining of the stomach is found to consist very largely of mucus-forming cells, which are
  swollen with large drops of mucus or some similar substance. It used to be supposed that this
  substance had some poisonous action on the prey and paralysed it, but the researches of Schiemenz
  show that this is incorrect. If when an <i>Asterias</i> is devouring a bivalve another be offered
  to it, it will open it, but will not digest it, and the victim shows no sign of injury but soon
  recovers. The cells forming the walls of the pyloric sac and its appendages are tall narrow
  cylindrical cells crowded with granules which appear to be of the nature of digestive ferment.
  This substance flows into the stomach and digests the captured prey.</p>

  <p>A very small amount of matter passes into the rectum and escapes by the anus, as the digestive
  powers of the Starfish are very complete. The rectal caeca are lined by cells which secrete from
  the coelomic fluid a brown material, in all probability an excretion, which is got rid of by the
  anus.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page441"><span class="smaller">{441}</span></span></div>

  <p>When the meal is finished the stomach is restored to its former place by the action of five
  pairs of retractor muscles, one pair of which originates from the upper surface of the ambulacral
  ossicles in each arm and extends to the wall of the stomach, where they are inserted (Fig. 190,
  <i>ret</i>).</p>

  <p>The tube-feet, which are at once the locomotor and the principal sensory organs of the
  Starfish, are appendages of that peculiar system of tubes known as the <b>water-vascular
  system</b>, which is derived from a part of the coelom cut off from the rest during the
  development of the animal. This system, as already mentioned, consists of (1) a narrow
  "ring-canal," encircling the mouth and lying on the inner surface of the membranous peristome; (2)
  a radial canal leaving the ring-canal and running along the under surface of each arm just above
  the ambulacral groove; (3) a vertical stone-canal running from the madreporite downwards to open
  into the ring-canal in the interspace between two arms. The madreporite is covered externally by
  grooves lined with long cilia, and is pierced with narrow canals of excessively fine calibre, the
  walls of which are also lined by powerful cilia. Most of these narrow canals open below into a
  main collecting canal, the stone-canal, but some open into a division of the coelom termed the
  axial sinus, with which also the stone-canal communicates by a lateral opening. The cavity of the
  stone-canal is reduced by the outgrowth from its walls of a peculiar Y-shaped projection, the ends
  being rolled on themselves in a complicated way (Fig. 190, B). The walls of the canal consist of a
  layer of very long narrow cells, which carry powerful flagella, and outside this of a crust of
  calcareous deposit, which gives rigidity to the walls and has suggested the name stone-canal.</p>

  <p>The tube-feet are covered externally by ectoderm, inside which is a tube in connexion with the
  radial water-vascular canal. This latter is lined by flattened cells, which in the very young
  Starfish are prolonged into muscular tails; in the older animal these tails are separated off as a
  distinct muscular layer lying between the ectoderm and the cells lining the cavity of the tube.
  The tube-foot is prolonged inwards into a bulb termed the "ampulla," which projects into the
  coelom of the arm and in consequence is covered outside by somatic peritoneum. Just where the
  ampulla passes into the tube-foot proper the organ passes downwards between two of the powerful
  ambulacral ossicles which support <span class="pagenum" id="page442"><span
  class="smaller">{442}</span></span>the ambulacral groove, and a little below this spot a short
  transverse canal connects the tube-foot with the radial canal which lies beneath these ossicles
  (Fig. 191).</p>

  </div>

  <p>The tube-feet are, therefore, really a double row of lateral branches of the radial canal. The
  appearance of being arranged in four rows is due to the fact that the transverse canals connecting
  them with the radial canal are alternately longer and shorter so as to give room for more
  tube-feet in a given length of the arm. Each tube-foot ends in a round disc with a slightly
  thickened edge. The radial canal terminates in a finger-shaped <span class="pagenum"
  id="page443"><span class="smaller">{443}</span></span>appendage, called the median tentacle, at
  the base of which is the eye.</p>

  <p>The manner in which this complicated system acts is as follows:&mdash;When the tube-foot is to
  be stretched out the ampulla contracts and drives the fluid downwards. The contraction of the
  ampulla is brought about by muscles running circularly around it. The tube-foot is thus distended
  and its broad flattened end is brought in contact with the surface of the stone over which it is
  moving and is pressed close against it. The muscles of the tube-foot itself, which are arranged
  longitudinally, now commence to act, and the pressure of the water preventing the tearing away of
  the sucker from the object to which it adheres, the Starfish is slowly drawn forward, whilst the
  fluid in the tube-foot flows back into the ampulla.</p>

      but not lettered.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>If each tube-foot were practically water-tight, then each would be entirely independent of all
  the rest, and it would not be easy to suggest a reason for the presence of the complicated system
  of radial canals and stone-canal. Just at the spot, however, where the transverse canal leading
  from the radial canal enters the tube-foot there is a pair of valves which open inwards and allow
  fluid to pass from the radial canal into the tube-foot but prevent any passing outwards in the
  reverse direction. The presence of these valves renders it probable that the tube-foot is not
  quite water-tight; that when it is distended under the pressure produced by the contraction of the
  muscles of the ampulla, some fluid escapes through the permeable walls; and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page444"><span class="smaller">{444}</span></span>that the loss thus suffered is made up by
  the entry of fresh fluid from the radial canal. The radial canal in turn draws from the
  ring-canal, and this last is supplied by the stone-canal, the cilia of which keep up a constant
  inward current.</p>

  <p>In the fluid contained in the water-vascular system, as in the coelomic fluid, there are
  amoebocytes floating about. These are produced in short pouches of the ring-canal, nine in number,
  which are called after their discoverer "Tiedemann's bodies" (Fig. 190, T). From the cells lining
  these the amoebocytes are budded off.</p>

  <p>The <b>nervous system</b> of the Starfish is in a very interesting condition. The essential
  characteristic of all nervous systems is the presence of the "neuron," a cell primitively
  belonging to an epithelium but which generally has sunk below the level of the others and lies
  amongst their bases. This type of cell possesses a round body produced in one direction into a
  long straight process, the "axon," whilst in the other it may have several root-like processes, or
  "dendrites," which may spring from a common stem, in which case the neuron is said to be
  "bipolar." The axon is often distinguished as a "nerve-fibre" from the round body which is termed
  the "nerve-cell." This is due to the fact that for a long time it was not recognised that these
  two structures are parts of a whole.</p>

  <p>Now at the base of the ectoderm all over the body of the Starfish there is to be found a very
  fine tangle of fibrils; these are to be found partly in connexion with small bipolar neurons lying
  amongst them and partly with isolated sense-cells scattered amongst the ordinary ectoderm cells.
  This nervous layer is, however, very much thickened in certain places, so as to cause the ectoderm
  to project as a ridge. One such ridge is found at the summit of each ambulacral groove running
  along the whole under surface of the arm and terminating in a cushion at the base of the median
  tentacle of the water-vascular system. This ridge is called the radial nerve-cord. The five radial
  nerve-cords are united by a circular cord, the nerve-ring, which appears as a thickening on the
  peristome surrounding the mouth.</p>

  <p>The sense-organs of the Starfish are chiefly the discs of the tube-feet. Round the edges of
  these there is a special aggregation of sense-cells; elsewhere, as in the skin of the back, only
  <span class="pagenum" id="page445"><span class="smaller">{445}</span></span>isolated sense-cells
  are found, and it becomes impossible to speak of a sense-organ.</p>

  <p>A prolongation of the radial nerve-cord extends outwards along one side of each tube-foot. This
  is often spoken of as the "pedal nerve," but the term nerve is properly retained for a mere bundle
  of axons such as we find in the higher animals, whereas the structure referred to contains the
  bodies of nerve-cells as well as their outgrowths or cell-fibres and is therefore a prolongation
  of the nerve-cord.</p>

  <p>At the base of the terminal tentacle the radial nerve-cord ends in a cushion. This cushion is
  called the "eye," for it is beset with a large number of cup-shaped pockets of the ectoderm. Each
  pocket is lined partly by cells containing a bright orange pigment and partly by visual cells each
  of which ends in a small clear rod projecting into the cavity of the pit (Fig. 193, A,
  <i>vis.r</i>). The pit is apparently closed by a thin sheet of cuticle secreted by the most
  superficial cells.</p>

  <p>An exposed nervous system and simple sense-organs such as the Starfish possesses lend
  themselves admirably to the purposes <span class="pagenum" id="page446"><span

  <p>The light-perceiving function of the eye is easily demonstrated. If a number of Starfish be put
  into a dark tank which is illuminated only by a narrow beam of light they will be found after an
  interval to have collected in the space reached by the beam of light.<a id="NtA_445"
  href="#Nt_445"><sup>[445]</sup></a> If all the median tentacles but one be removed this will still
  be the case; if, however, they are all removed the Starfish will exhibit indifference to the
  light.</p>

  <p>If the under surface of a Starfish be irritated by an electric shock or a hot needle, or a drop
  of acid, the tube-feet of the affected area will be strongly retracted, and this irritation will
  be carried by the pedal nerves to the radial nerve-cord, with the result that finally all the
  tube-feet in the groove will be retracted and the groove closed by the action of the transverse
  muscle connecting each ambulacral ossicle with its fellow. If, on the other hand, the back of a
  Starfish be irritated this may produce a contraction of the tube-feet if the irritation be strong,
  but this will be followed by active alternate expansions and contractions, in a word, by
  endeavours to move. Preyer<a id="NtA_446" href="#Nt_446"><sup>[446]</sup></a> by suspending a
  Starfish ventral surface upward, by <span class="pagenum" id="page447"><span
  class="smaller">{447}</span></span>means of a small zinc plate to which a string was attached
  which passed through a hole bored in the back and through the mouth, caused movements of this
  description which lasted for hours. Irritation of the back causes also activity of the local
  pedicellariae, which open their valves widely and then close them with a snap in the endeavour to
  seize the aggressor.</p>

  <p>The uninjured Starfish in moving pursues a definite direction, one arm being generally directed
  forwards, but this may be any one of the five. The tube-feet of this arm are directed forwards
  when they are stretched out, by the slightly unequal contraction of the longitudinal muscles of
  opposite sides of the foot, which persists even when the circular muscles of the ampulla are
  contracting. They thus may be said to swing parallel to the long axis of the arm. The tube-feet of
  the other arms assist in the movement, and hence swing obliquely with reference to the long axis
  of the arm to which they belong, although they move parallel to the general direction in which the
  Starfish is moving. A change in the direction of the swing of the tube-feet will bring about a
  change in the direction of the movement of the animal as a whole. If now the connexion of each
  radial nerve-cord with the nerve-ring be cut through, each arm will act as a separate Starfish and
  will move its tube-feet without reference to the movement of those in the other arms, so that the
  animal is pulled first one way and then another according as the influence first of one arm and
  then of another predominates. Similarly, when a Starfish is placed on its back, it rights itself
  by the combined action of the tube-feet of all the arms, extending them all as widely as possible,
  those which first catch hold being used as the pivot for the turning movement. If, however, the
  radial nerve-cords are cut through, each arm tries to right itself and it is only by chance that
  the efforts of one so predominate as to turn the whole animal over. From these experiments it is
  clear that the nerve-ring acts as co-ordinator of the movements of the Starfish, that is to say as
  its brain.</p>

  <p>If a section be taken across the arm of a Starfish (Fig. 191), it will be seen that between the
  V-shaped ridge constituting the radial nerve-cord and the radial water-vascular canal there are
  two canals lying side by side and separated from one another by a vertical septum. These canals
  are not mere splits in the <span class="pagenum" id="page448"><span
  class="smaller">{448}</span></span>substance of the body-wall, but have a well-defined wall of
  flattened cells. They are termed, for reasons which will be explained subsequently, <b>perihaemal
  canals</b>, and they open into a circular canal called the "outer perihaemal ring," situated just
  beneath the water-vascular ring-canal (Fig. 192, <i>perih</i>). These canals originate as
  outgrowths from the coelom. From their upper walls are developed the muscles which connect the
  pairs of ambulacral ossicles and close the groove, and also those which connect each ossicle with
  its successor and predecessor and help to elevate or depress the tip of the arm.</p>

  <p>In most of the higher animals the processes of many of the ganglion-cells are connected
  together in bundles called "motor nerves," which can be traced into contact with the muscles, and
  thus the path along which the stimulus travels in order to evoke movement can clearly be seen. No
  such well-defined nerves can be made out in the case of the Starfish, and it is therefore
  interesting when exceptionally the paths along which stimuli travel to the muscles can be traced.
  This can be done in the case of the muscles mentioned above. Whereas they originate from the
  dorsal walls of the perihaemal canals, ganglion-cells develop from the ventral walls of these
  canals, which are in close contact with the nerve-cord, so that the nervous system of the Starfish
  is partly ectodermic and partly coelomic in origin. Stimuli reaching the ectodermic ganglion-cells
  are transmitted by them to the nervous part of the wall of the perihaemal canal and from that to
  the muscular portion of the same layer of cells.</p>

  <p>Besides the radial perihaemal canals and their connecting outer perihaemal ring there are
  several other tubular extensions of the coelom found in the body-wall. These are<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(1) The "inner perihaemal canal," a circular canal in close contact with the inner side of the
  outer perihaemal canal (Fig. 192, <i>ax</i><sup>1</sup>).</p>

  <p>(2) The "axial sinus" (<i>ax</i>) a wide vertical canal embedded in the body-wall outside the
  stone-canal. This canal opens into the inner perihaemal canal below; above it opens into several
  of the pore-canals and into the stone-canal. The separation of the axial sinus from the rest of
  the coelom is the remains of a feebly marked metamerism in the larva.</p>

  <p>(3) The "madreporic vesicle," a closed sac embedded in the dorsal body-wall just under the
  madreporite. This sac by its <span class="pagenum" id="page449"><span
  class="smaller">{449}</span></span>history in the larva appears to be a rudimentary counterpart of
  the water-vascular system, since this organ in correspondence with the general bilateral symmetry
  of the larva is at first paired. Into this a special process of the genital stolon projects.</p>

  <p>(4) The "aboral sinus" (Fig. 192, <i>ab</i>), a tube embedded in the dorsal body-wall running
  horizontally round the disc. The aboral sinus surrounds the genital rachis (see p. <a
  href="#page452">452</a>) and gives off into each arm two branches, the ends of which swell so as
  to surround the genital organs. It has no connexion with the axial sinus though the contrary has
  often been stated by Ludwig.<a id="NtA_447" href="#Nt_447"><sup>[447]</sup></a></p>

  <p>(5) The "peribranchial spaces," circular spaces which surround the basal parts of the papulae
  (Fig. 192, <i>p.br</i>).</p>

  <p>Besides these, large irregular spaces have been described as existing in the body-wall by
  Hamann<a id="NtA_448" href="#Nt_448"><sup>[448]</sup></a> and other authors, but for various
  reasons and especially because they possess no definite wall they appear to be nothing more than
  rents caused by the escape of CO<sub>2</sub> gas during the process of decalcifying, to which the
  tissues of the Starfish must be subjected before it is easy to cut sections of them.</p>

  <p>The question as to whether or not there is a <b>blood system</b> in the Starfish has an
  interesting history. It must be remembered that the examination of the structure of Echinodermata
  was first undertaken by human anatomists, who approached the subject imbued with the idea that
  representatives of all the systems of organs found in the human subject would be found in the
  lower animals also. So the perihaemal canals were originally described as blood-vessels. Later,
  Ludwig<a id="NtA_449" href="#Nt_449"><sup>[449]</sup></a> discovered a strand of strongly staining
  material running in each septum which separates the two perihaemal canals of the arm. Each of
  these radial strands could be traced into connexion with a circular strand interposed between the
  outer and the inner perihaemal ring-canals. This circular strand again came into connexion with a
  brown, lobed organ, lying in the wall of the axial sinus, and this in turn <span class="pagenum"
  id="page450"><span class="smaller">{450}</span></span>joined at its upper end a circular cord of
  pigmented material adhering to the dorsal wall of the coelom (lying in fact within the aboral
  sinus), from which branches could be traced to the generative organs. Ludwig concluded that he had
  at last discovered the true blood-vessels, though the facts that the radial strands and the oral
  circular strand absorbed neutral carmine strongly and that the vertical and aboral strands were
  pigmented, constituted a very slender basis on which to found such a conclusion. The colour
  apparently appealed to the imagination, and it is undoubtedly true that the "plasma" or
  blood-fluid of other animals often absorbs stain strongly.</p>

  <p>The strands were accordingly named "radial blood-vessels," "oral blood-ring," "aboral
  blood-ring"; and the brown vertical strand was called the "heart," although no circulation or
  pulsations had ever been observed. When later investigations revealed the fact that the so-called
  heart was practically solid, the term "central blood-plexus" was substituted for heart, although
  it was still regarded as the central organ of the system. The name "perihaemal" was given to the
  spaces so called because they surrounded the supposed blood-vessels.</p>

  <p>In order to come to a satisfactory conclusion on the matter some general idea as to the
  fundamental nature and function of the blood-vessels in general must be arrived at. Investigations
  made on various groups of animals, such as Annelida, Mollusca, Crustacea, Vertebrata, show that at
  an early period of development a considerable space intervenes between the alimentary canal and
  the ectoderm, which is filled with a more or less fluid jelly. Into this cavity, the so-called
  "primary body-cavity" or "archicoel," amoebocytes, budded from the ectoderm or endoderm or both,
  penetrate. In this jelly with its contained amoebocytes is to be found the common rudiment both of
  the connective tissue and of the blood system. The resemblance of the archicoele and its contents
  to the jelly of a Medusa is too obvious to require special insistence on, and therefore in the
  Coelenterata it may be stated that there is to be found a tissue which is neither blood system nor
  connective tissue but is the forerunner of both.</p>

  <p>In the higher animals as development proceeds the jelly undergoes differentiation, for some of
  the amoebocytes become stationary and connected with their pseudopodia so as to form a
  protoplasmic network. A portion of this network becomes <span class="pagenum" id="page451"><span
  class="smaller">{451}</span></span>altered into tough fibres, but a portion of each strand remains
  living, and in this way the connective tissue is formed. In the interstices of the network of
  fibres a semi-fluid substance (the unaltered jelly) is found, and this is traversed by free,
  wandering amoebocytes. In other places the jelly becomes more fluid and forms the plasma, or
  liquid of the blood, whilst the amoebocytes form the blood corpuscles. The blood system thus
  arises from regions of the archicoel where fibres are not precipitated.</p>

  <p>Now in the Starfish the whole substance of the body-wall intervening between the ectoderm and
  the coelomic epithelium really represents the archicoel. The formation of fibres has, it is true,
  proceeded to a certain extent, since there are interlacing bundles of these, but there are left
  wide meshes in which amoebocytes can still move freely. Apart from the skeleton, therefore, the
  tissues of the body-wall of the Starfish do not exhibit much advance on those of a Jellyfish. If
  anything is to be compared to the blood system of the higher animals it must be these meshes in
  the connective tissue. From observations made on other Echinoderms it appears probable that the
  colour of the skin is due to amoebocytes loaded with pigment wandering outwards through the jelly
  of the body-wall and disintegrating there. The strands regarded as blood-vessels by Ludwig are
  specially modified tracts of connective tissue in which fibres are sparse, and in which there are
  large quantities of amoebocytes and in which the "jelly" stains easily. Cu&eacute;not<a id="NtA_450"
  href="#Nt_450"><sup>[450]</sup></a> suggests that they are placed where new amoebocytes are
  formed; this is quite possible, and in this case they ought to be compared to the spleen and other
  lymphatic organs of Vertebrates, and not to the blood-vessels.<a id="NtA_451"
  href="#Nt_451"><sup>[451]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The organ regarded as the heart, however, belongs to a different category: it is really the
  original seat of the <b>genital cells</b> and should be termed the "genital stolon." Careful
  sections show that at its upper end it is continuous with a strand of primitive germ-cells which
  lies inside the so-called aboral <span class="pagenum" id="page452"><span
  class="smaller">{452}</span></span>blood-vessel, and is termed the "genital rachis" (Fig. 192,
  <i>g.r</i>). The germ-cells are distinguished by their large nuclei and their granular protoplasm.
  The genital organs are only local swellings of the genital rachis, and from the shape of some of
  the germ-cells it is regarded as highly probable that the primitive germ-cells wander along the
  rachis and accumulate in the genital organs. The genital rachis itself is an outgrowth from the
  genital stolon, and this latter originates as a pocket-like ingrowth of the coelom into the wall
  separating it from the axial sinus; when fully formed it projects into and is apparently contained
  in this latter space.</p>

  <p>Not all the cells forming the genital stolon become sexual cells. Many degenerate and become
  pigment-cells, a circumstance to which the organ owes its brown colour. In very many species of
  Starfish many of the cells of the genital rachis undergo a similar degeneration, and hence is
  produced the apparent aboral blood-vessel. Further, the rachis is embedded in connective tissue
  which has undergone what we may call the "lymphatic" modification, and this for want of a better
  name we call the "aboral" blood-ring.</p>

  <p>The size of the genital organs varies with the season of the year; they are feather-shaped, and
  attached to the genital rachis by their bases, but project freely into the coelom of the arm. From
  their great variation in size and also from the shape of some of the cells in the genital rachis,
  Hamann concludes that as each period of maturity approaches fresh germ-cells are formed in the
  rachis and wander into the genital organ and grow there in size. It is probable that the aboral
  end of the genital stolon is the seat of the formation of new germ-cells.</p>

  <p>In the Starfish, therefore, as in other animals with a well-defined coelom, the genital cells
  ultimately originate from the coelomic wall.</p>

  <p>The genital ducts are formed by the burrowing outwards of the germ-cells. When it is remembered
  that the fundamental substance of the body-wall is semi-fluid jelly, this process will be better
  understood.</p>

  <p>When the ova and spermatozoa are ripe, they are simply shed out into the sea and fertilisation
  occurs there. The development is described in Chapter XXI. The free-swimming larval period lasts
  about six weeks.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page453"><span class="smaller">{453}</span></span></div>

  <p>Having described a single species with some degree of fulness, we must now give some account of
  the range of variation of structure met with in the group.</p>

  <p><b>Number of Arms.</b>&mdash;In the overwhelming majority of Starfish the number of arms is 5,
  but deviations from this rule are met with not only as individual variations, but as the
  characteristics of species, genera, and even families.</p>

  <p>The number 5 is rarely diminished, but amongst a large collection of specimens of <i>Asterina
  gibbosa</i>, belonging to the author, some 4-rayed individuals are met with. One species of
  <i>Culcita</i>, <i>C. tetragona</i>, is normally 4-rayed.</p>

  <p>On the other hand the number 5 is often exceeded. The families Heliasteridae and Brisingidae
  are characterised by possessing numerous (19-25) arms. In the normally 5-rayed family Asteriidae
  <i>Pycnopodia</i> has 22 arms; and in the Solasteridae the genera <i>Rhipidaster</i> and
  <i>Solaster</i> are characterised by possessing 8 and 11-15 arms respectively; whilst
  <i>Korethraster</i> and <i>Peribolaster</i> have only 5. The common Starfish of the Gulf of St.
  Lawrence, <i>Asterias polaris</i>, is 6-rayed, whilst most of the other species of the same genus
  are 5-rayed, though 6 rays are often met with as a variation.</p>

  <p>In some species the fact that the number of arms exceeds 5 seems to be connected with the power
  of multiplication by transverse fission. Thus Ludwig<a id="NtA_452"
  href="#Nt_452"><sup>[452]</sup></a> has shown that in <i>Asterias tenuispina</i> the number of
  arms is usually 7, but sometimes 5, 6, or 8, and that in most cases the arms are arranged in two
  groups&mdash;one consisting of small arms, the other of large.</p>

  <p><b>Shape.</b>&mdash;Apart from the varying number of arms, differences in the shape of the
  Starfish are due to two circumstances<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(1) The proportion of breadth to length of arm; and</p>

  <p>(2) The amount of adhesion between adjacent arms.</p>

  <p>The adhesion can go so far that the animal acquires the shape of a pentagonal disc. This is the
  case for instance in <i>Culcita</i>. The fact that the body of this animal is really composed of
  adherent arms is at once made clear when the coelom is opened. This space is found to be divided
  up by inwardly projecting folds called interradial septa, which are stiffened by calcareous
  deposits and represent the conjoined adjacent walls of two arms.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page454"><span class="smaller">{454}</span></span></div>

  <p>In the family Heliasteridae the mutual adhesion between the arms has gone on merely to a slight
  extent, for the interradial septa are still double.</p>

  <p><b>Skeleton.</b>&mdash;Most of the schemes of classification have been founded on the skeleton,
  largely because the greater number of species have only been examined in the dried condition, and
  little is known of their internal anatomy or habits. There is, however, this justification for
  this procedure, that the habits and food of the species (with the exception of the Paxillosa)
  which have been observed in the living condition appear to be very uniform, and that it is with
  regard to the skeleton that Asteroidea seem to have split into divergent groups through adopting
  different means of protecting themselves from their foes.</p>

  <p>The description of the various elements of the skeleton will be arranged under the following
  heads:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Main framework; (<i>b</i>) Spines; (<i>c</i>) Pedicellariae; (<i>d</i>)
  Ambulacral skeleton.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) <b>Main Framework</b>.&mdash;The type of skeleton which supports the body-wall of
  <i>Asterias</i> is called reticulate. As already indicated it consists of a series of rods bound
  together by bundles of connective-tissue fibres so as to form a mesh-work. This is a very common
  type of aboral skeleton, but in a large number of Starfish a different type occurs, consisting of
  a series of plates which may fit edge to edge, leaving between them only narrow interstices, as in
  the Zoroasteridae, or which may be placed obliquely (as in <i>Asterina</i>) so that they imbricate
  or overlap one another. In a very large number of Asteroidea the supero- and infero-marginal
  ossicles are represented by squarish plates even when the rest of the skeleton is reticulate; this
  is the so-called "phanerozonate" structure, the term "cryptozonate" being used when the marginals
  are rod-like and inconspicuous. In other cases (Ganeriidae) the whole skeleton of the ventral
  surface is made of tightly fitting plates, whilst the aboral skeleton is either reticulate or made
  of imbricating plates. Lastly, the skeleton may be represented only by nodules forming the bases
  of paxillae (see p. <a href="#page455">455</a>), as in the Astropectinidae, or may be entirely
  absent over wide areas (Brisingidae).</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Spines</b>.&mdash;The spines vary more than any other part of the skeleton. They
  may be close set and small, or few and large, and often bear spines of the second order, or
  spinelets, attached to them. In <i>Asterias</i> and its allies they are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page455"><span class="smaller">{455}</span></span>comparatively short, blunt tubercles,
  covered with thick skin. In the Echinasteridae and Asterinidae they are short and blunt, but they
  are very numerous and thick set. In the Solasteridae they are long, and arranged in bundles
  diverging from a common base. Such bundles may be termed sheaves, and starting from an arrangement
  like this, two distinct lines of modification may be traced. Thus (1) the members of a sheaf
  become connected by a web of skin, so that the sheaf becomes an umbrella, and successive umbrellas
  may adhere, so that a supra-dorsal tent is formed (a structure characteristic of the
  Pterasteridae), or (2) the members of a sheaf may become arranged in a circle round a central
  vertical axis so that a structure like a capstan is produced, which is called a "paxilla"
  (characteristic of Astropectinidae, Porcellanasteridae, and Archasteridae). The axis,<a
  id="NtA_453" href="#Nt_453"><sup>[453]</sup></a> as shown by its development, represents the plate
  which bore the bundle of spines. Again, the skeleton may consist of plates with a close covering
  of granules (Pentagonasteridae, etc.). Lastly, in <i>Porania</i> spines are absent, the plates
  being deeply embedded in a thick leathery skin.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) <b>Pedicellariae</b>.&mdash;These are to be looked on as spines of the second order.
  In <i>Asterina</i> and its allies they are not present, but groups of little spines arranged in
  twos and threes, each group being attached to a special small plate, are scattered over the aboral
  surface; and these on irritation approach one another, and represent the rudiment out of which
  pedicellariae have been developed. The most perfect form, termed "forcipulate," in which there is
  a basal ossicle, is found in Asteriidae, Brisingidae, Heliasteridae, Pedicellasteridae,
  Zoroasteridae, Stichasteridae. There are two varieties of forcipulate pedicellariae, the "crossed"
  and the "straight," which have been described on p. <a href="#page432">432</a>. In all other cases
  the pedicellariae are devoid of the basal ossicle, and the two or more spinelets forming the jaws
  are directly attached to one of the main plates of the skeleton.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig195.jpg"><img style="width:23%" src="images/fig195.jpg" alt="fig195"

    <div class="smaller aj">
      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 195.</span>&mdash;Different forms of pedicellariae
      (excluding the forcipulate form, for which see Fig. 186). <b>A</b>, pectinate; <b>B</b>,

      <b>F</b>, alveolate, from above. &times; 10. (After Sladen.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The simplest variety is termed "pectinate"; these pedicellariae are composed of two parallel
  rows of small spines opposed to each other. They are found in the Archasteridae, and are hardly
  more advanced in structure than the groups of spines found in <i>Asterina</i>. In
  <i>Leptogonaster</i> and its allies there are pincer-shaped pedicellariae composed of two curved
  rods articulating with one of the plates of the skeleton, and also "alveolate" pedicellariae,
  composed of two short prongs which are implanted on a concave tubercle borne on one of the plates
  of the skeleton. In the Antheneidae every plate of the ventral surface bears a large "valvate"
  pedicellaria consisting of two horizontally elongated ridges, which can meet one another. It is
  possible that valvate pedicellariae have been derived from a pectinate form in which successive
  spinules of one row have become adherent.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) <b>Ambulacral Skeleton</b>.&mdash;In every case, whether spines are developed
  elsewhere or not, the adambulacral plates bear spines. Where the spines are elsewhere represented
  by granules (<i>Nardoa</i> and its allies) (Fig. 194, D) the adambulacral spines are <span
  class="pagenum" id="page457"><span class="smaller">{457}</span></span>short and blunt. The terms
  "monacanthid" and "diplacanthid" are used to express the occurrence of one or two rows of spines
  respectively on each adambulacral plate.</p>

  <p>In the Zoroasteridae the adambulacral plates are curved, and are alternately convex and concave
  towards the ambulacral groove, so that this groove presents a wavy outline.</p>

  <p>In the description of <i>Asterias</i> it was pointed out that the first adambulacral plates in
  adjacent radii are closely approximated to one another, and bear spines which can to some extent
  form a trellis-work over the mouth. In very many species not only is this the case, but the plates
  themselves project inwards over the mouth so as to form prominent "mouth-angles." This is not the
  case in the Asteriidae or the allied families.</p>

  <p><b>Papulae.</b>&mdash;In Asteriidae and many allied families these organs are found both on the
  upper and under surface of the disc, but in another large group consisting of Astropectinidae,
  Pentacerotidae, and allied families, papulae are only borne on the dorsal surface, and, in some
  cases, are restricted to a few groups at the base of the arms. In most Asteroidea the papulae are
  arranged singly, that is to say, each occupies one of the interspaces between the plates of the
  skeleton, but in <i>Asterias</i> and some other genera they are arranged in tufts of two or
  three.</p>

  <p><b>Water-vascular System.</b>&mdash;In its general structure this system of organs is very
  constant, the two most important variations being found, one, in Asteriidae and a few allied
  families, and the other, in the Astropectinidae and the families allied to them.</p>

  <p>The first of the variations alluded to concerns the number of the tube-feet in a radius. In
  <i>Asterias</i> and its allies these are so numerous that there is not room for them one behind
  the other, but they follow one another in a zigzag line, the transverse canals connecting them
  with the radial canals being alternately longer and shorter. In this way the appearance of four
  rows of tube-feet is produced, and the advantage of this increase in number can be recognised by
  any one who has compared the quick movements of <i>Asterias</i> and the slow ones of a
  <i>Cribrella</i>, for instance.</p>

  <p>The second important variation referred to is the complete loss of the sucker of the tube-foot,
  and, concomitantly, the loss <span class="pagenum" id="page458"><span
  class="smaller">{458}</span></span>of the power of climbing. Starfish which have undergone this
  change live on sandy bottoms and run over the surface of the sand. They are also incapable of
  forcing asunder the valves of Molluscs, and hence are compelled to swallow their prey whole.</p>

  <p>"Polian vesicles," or stalked sac-like outgrowths of the water-vascular ring, are absent from
  the Asteriidae, but are found in many families&mdash;the Asterinidae, Solasteridae,
  Astropectinidae, for example. They project outwards from the water-vascular ring in the
  interradii; when there are several present in one interradius they often arise from a common
  stalk. Cu&eacute;not believes that their sole function, like that of Tiedemann's bodies, is to produce
  amoebocytes, but this appears unlikely. It is more probable that they act as store-houses of fluid
  for the water-vascular ring.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">
    <a href="images/fig196.jpg"><img style="width:26%" src="images/fig196.jpg" alt="fig196"

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The stone-canal is rarely repeated, but this occurs in the aberrant genus <i>Acanthaster</i>,
  where there may even be several in one interradius, and each stone-canal has an axial sinus,
  genital stolon, and madreporite annexed to it. According to Cu&eacute;not, in <i>Asterias</i>, when
  6-rayed specimens occur in a species normally 5-rayed, there are two stone-canals, suggesting that
  the repetition of stone-canals is a suppressed effort at multiplication by division. This is also
  true of <i>Echinaster</i>, but in <i>Ophidiaster</i> two madreporites may occur in an individual
  with five arms. In the Asterinidae the Y-shaped fold which projects into the cavity of the
  stone-canal is feebly developed, whereas in the Pentacerotidae it meets the opposite side of the
  stone-canal, and in <i>Culcita</i> gives out branches which reduce the cavity of the canal to a
  series of channels. In Echinasteridae and some Asterinidae, and in Astropectinidae and
  Pentacerotidae the ampullae become so deeply indented as to be almost divided into two, so that
  each tube-foot has virtually two ampullae.</p>

  <p>The <b>alimentary canal</b> has a remarkably constant structure. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page459"><span class="smaller">{459}</span></span>The only important variation from the type,
  as described in <i>Asterias</i>, is found amongst the Astropectinidae and Porcellanasteridae,
  where the anus is wanting. In <i>Astropecten</i> the rectum and the rectal caeca still persist,
  but in <i>Luidia</i> even these have disappeared. The rectal caeca are remarkably variable
  structures. In <i>Asterias</i> there are two, but in Pentacerotidae there are five forked caeca,
  in <i>Asterina</i> five simple caeca, and in the Echinasteridae and Astropectinidae one large flat
  slightly 5-lobed caecum. In the Asterinidae the pyloric caeca are remarkable for the size of the
  enlarged basal portion in each radius, which serves as a reservoir for the juices secreted by the
  branched forks of the caecum. In <i>Porcellanaster pacificus</i> the pyloric caeca are vestigial,
  and in <i>Hyphalaster moseri</i> they are absent.<a id="NtA_454"
  href="#Nt_454"><sup>[454]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <b>genital organs</b> are, as we have seen, outgrowths from radial branches of the genital
  rachis. In most species, as in <i>Asterias</i>, they are limited to a single cluster of tubes on
  each branch of the rachis, but in the Astropectinidae and Pentacerotidae each branch gives rise to
  a large number of clusters, arranged in longitudinal series, each cluster having its independent
  opening to the exterior.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Asexual reproduction</b>, as a regular occurrence, is not common amongst
  Asteroidea. If, however, a Starfish loses some of its arms, it has the power of regenerating the
  missing members. Even a single arm will regenerate the whole Starfish. Now in some cases
  (Astropectinidae, Linckiidae) Starfish will readily snap off their arms on irritation. In
  <i>Linckia</i> this occurs at regular intervals and the separated arm forms a new individual. In
  one of the Asterinidae, <i>Asterina wega</i>, a small Starfish with seven arms, transverse fission
  regularly occurs, a portion with three arms separating from one with four. The same is believed to
  occur in two species of <i>Asterias</i>, and as has already been pointed out, the repetition of
  the madreporite and stone-canal is, in many cases, possibly connected with this tendency to
  transverse fission.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Classification of Asteroidea.</b></p>

  <p>Whilst there is considerable agreement amongst the authorities as to the number of families, or
  minor divisions of unequivocal <span class="pagenum" id="page460"><span
  class="smaller">{460}</span></span>relationship, to be found in the class Asteroidea, there has
  been great uncertainty both as to the number and limits of the orders into which the class should
  be divided, and also as to the limits of the various species. The difficulty about the species is
  by no means confined to the group Echinodermata; in all cases where the attempt is made to
  determine species by an examination of a few specimens of unknown age there is bound to be
  uncertainty; the more so, as it becomes increasingly evident that there is no sharp line to be
  drawn between local varieties and species. In Echinodermata, however, there is the additional
  difficulty that the acquisition of ripe genital cells does not necessarily mark the termination of
  growth; the animals can continue to grow and at the same time slightly alter their characters. For
  this reason many of the species described may be merely immature forms. In proportion, however, as
  the collections from various localities increase in number and size, difficulties connected with
  species will tend to disappear.</p>

  <p>The disputes, however, as to the number of orders included in the Asteroidea proceed from a
  different cause. The attempt to construct detailed phylogenies involves the assumption that one
  set of structures, which we take as the mark of the class, has remained constant, whilst others
  which are regarded as adaptive, may have been developed twice or thrice. As the two sets of
  structures are often of about equal importance it will be seen to what an enormous extent the
  personal equation enters in the determination of these questions.</p>

  <p>Where, as in Asteroidea, the internal organisation is very uniform, the best method of
  classification is to take as our basis the different methods in which the demands of the
  environment have been met. It is in this way, we hold, that divergence of character has been
  produced, for whilst species may differ in trifling details, families and orders differ in points
  of functional importance. The fact that one of the orders may have sprung from several allied
  species instead of one may be admitted, and at the same time the hopelessness of trying to push
  phylogenetic inference into details asserted.</p>

  <p>Sladen, in his Monograph of the Asteroidea collected by the "Challenger" expedition, took for
  the basis of his system the presence or absence of distinct pavement-like marginal plates along
  the edges of the arms and the restriction of the papulae to <span class="pagenum"
  id="page461"><span class="smaller">{461}</span></span>the aboral surface, or their distribution
  over the whole surface of the body. What connexion, if any, the presence of these pavement-like
  plates has with the habits it is impossible to say, but it is unlikely to be of the high
  importance with which it was regarded by Sladen, for in the same family we have genera with
  inconspicuous marginals (<i>Asterina</i>) and others with conspicuous marginals (<i>Palmipes</i>).
  The restriction of the papulae to the back also varies within the same family (Linckiidae), and
  whilst, on the whole, it is perhaps a primitive arrangement, it is in many cases connected with
  burrowing habits, which can scarcely be deemed to have been the original mode of life of the
  class.</p>

  <p>A far better basis is supplied by the system of Perrier,<a id="NtA_455"
  href="#Nt_455"><sup>[455]</sup></a> who divides the Asteroidea into five orders according to the
  character of the dorsal skeleton; and this classification really corresponds with the different
  habits assumed by groups of Asteroidea in order to meet what must be regarded as one of their
  chief dangers, viz. assaults by other animals, especially parasites, on their soft and delicate
  skins. Since the food (so far as is known) of all Asteroidea is more or less similar, the great
  differentiating factor in their development must have been the means they adopt to shelter
  themselves from their enemies. Perrier's classification, which we shall adopt, is as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Order 1. Spinulosa.</span>&mdash;Asteroidea in which the plates of the dorsal
  skeleton bear spines arranged singly or in groups. The tube-feet have suckers and there are no
  pedicellariae. Marginals sometimes conspicuous, sometimes rod-like.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Order 2. Velata.</span>&mdash;Asteroidea in which the dorsal surface of the
  animal is concealed from view by a false membrane composed of the webs of skin stretched between
  diverging groups of spines united at the base with one another. No pedicellariae. Tube-feet with
  suckers.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Order 3. Paxillosa.</span>&mdash;Asteroidea in which the dorsal surface is
  beset with paxillae (upright spines bearing two or three circles of horizontal spinelets).
  Pedicellariae, when present, few, and never of the forcipulate variety; often absent. Marginals
  large. Papulae only on dorsal surface. Tube-feet mostly devoid of suckers.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Order 4. Valvata.</span>&mdash;Asteroidea in which the dorsal surface <span
  class="pagenum" id="page462"><span class="smaller">{462}</span></span>is protected by plates
  covered with a mail of minute granules. Pedicellariae of the valvate or alveolate type. Marginals
  large.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">Order 5. Forcipulata.</span>&mdash;Asteroidea in which the dorsal
  surface is beset with small spines surrounded by numerous forcipulate pedicellariae. Tube-feet
  with suckers and arranged in four rows. Marginals rod-like and inconspicuous.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Spinulosa.</b></p>

  <p>This is by far the most primitive order of Asteroidea. The tube-feet are arranged in two rows
  only, and there is no special means of protecting the back, other than the small close-set plates
  bearing spines, with which it is covered. In some cases, as <i>Asterina</i>, these spines have a
  tendency to converge when irritated, and thus act somewhat like pedicellariae. This circumstance
  suggests strongly the manner in which pedicellariae have been developed from small groups of
  spines. The order is divided into six families, of which four have common representatives on the
  British coast.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Echinasteridae.</b>&mdash;Spinulosa in which the aboral skeleton is composed of
  close set plates bearing comparatively small spines. This family is represented on the British
  coasts by the beautiful scarlet Starfish <i>Cribrella</i> (<i>Henricia</i>) <i>sanguinolenta</i>.
  It is also found on the Norwegian coast and on the east coast of North America. On the Pacific
  coast it is replaced by a larger species, <i>C. laeviuscula</i>. The narrow ambulacral grooves and
  sluggish movements at once distinguish it from the Starfish described as the type. Indeed, all the
  Spinulosa seem to be slow in their movements in contrast to the comparatively active
  <i>Asterias</i> and its allies. <i>Cribrella</i> is remarkable for its large eggs, which have a
  rapid development. The larva never swims at the surface but glides only for a short time over the
  bottom. <i>Echinaster</i> is an allied genus in which each plate bears a single somewhat enlarged
  spine. It possesses on the skin of the aboral surface numerous pits lined by glandular walls,
  which probably secrete a poisonous fluid which defends it. <i>Acanthaster</i> has thorny spines,
  more than ten arms, and several stone-canals and madreporites.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Solasteridae.</b>&mdash;Spinulosa in which the aboral skeleton is a network of rods.
  Spines arranged in diverging bundles <span class="pagenum" id="page463"><span
  class="smaller">{463}</span></span>(sheaves) attached to a basal button. This family includes the
  well-known "Sun-stars," with numerous arms and a wide peristome. There are two species found on
  both sides of the Atlantic. <i>Solaster papposus</i>, with thirteen or fourteen arms and long
  bundles of spines on the dorsal surface, which is of an orange colour variegated with yellow, and
  <i>S. endeca</i> with eleven rays and shorter spines and of a reddish violet colour.
  <i>Rhipidaster</i> has eight arms. Some genera have, however, only five arms, as, for instance,
  <i>Peribolaster</i> and <i>Korethraster</i> (Fig. 197). In this family there are conspicuous
  "Polian vesicles" attached to the water-vascular ring.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Asterinidae.</b>&mdash;Spinulosa in which the aboral skeleton consists of
  overlapping plates, each bearing a few small spines. The common British representative of this
  family is the small <i>Asterina gibbosa</i>, in which the arms are short and stout and of somewhat
  unequal length. This Starfish differs from most of its allies in being littoral in its habit. At
  low tide on the south and west coasts of England it can be found on the underside of stones
  feeding on the Sponges and Ascidians with which they are covered. Like <i>Cribrella
  sanguinolenta</i> this species has a modified development. The larva resembles that of
  <i>Cribrella</i>, and the larval stage only lasts about a week. Owing to the fact that <span
  class="pagenum" id="page464"><span class="smaller">{464}</span></span><i>Asterina</i> lays its
  eggs in accessible localities, its development has been more thoroughly worked out than that of
  any other species. <i>Palmipes membranaceus</i>, an animal of extraordinary thinness and flatness,
  is sometimes dredged up off the coast of Britain in deeper water. Its arms are so short that the
  general form is pentagonal. The infero-marginal plates are long and rod-like, and form a
  conspicuous border to the body when viewed from below.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Poraniidae.</b>&mdash;Spinulosa allied to the Asterinidae but possessing a thick
  gelatinous body-wall in which the plates and spines are buried, the marginals forming a
  conspicuous border to the body. This family is represented in British waters only by <i>Porania
  pulvillus</i>, a cushion-shaped Starfish with very short arms and of a magnificent reddish-purple
  colour. It is occasionally, but rarely, exposed at low tide.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Ganeriidae.</b>&mdash;Spinulosa allied to the Asterinidae but distinguished by the
  large marginals and by the fact that the skeleton of the oral surface consists of plates each
  bearing a few large spines. <i>Ganeria</i>, <i>Marginaster</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Mithrodiidae.</b>&mdash;Spinulosa with a reticulate aboral skeleton. The spines are
  large and blunt, covered with minute spinules. <i>Mithrodia</i>, sole genus.</p>

  <p class="sp3">These last two families are not represented in British waters.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Velata.</b></p>

  <p>This is a very extraordinary group of Starfish, about the habits of which nothing is known,
  since they all live at very considerable depths. Their nearest allies amongst the Spinulosa must
  be looked for amongst the Solasteridae. If the sheaves of spines with which the latter family are
  provided were to become adherent at their bases, and connected with webs of skin so as to form
  umbrella-like structures, and if then these umbrellas were to become united at their edges, we
  should have a supra-dorsal membrane formed such as is characteristic of the order.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Pythonasteridae.</b>&mdash;Velata in which each sheaf of spines is enveloped in a
  globular expansion of the skin and is not united with the neighbouring sheaves.
  <i>Pythonaster</i>, sole genus.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Myxasteridae.</b>&mdash;Velata with numerous arms in which the sheaves of spines are
  long and form with their connecting "umbrellas" web-like expansions which do not fuse with one
  another. <i>Myxaster</i>, sole genus.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page466"><span class="smaller">{466}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 3. Pterasteridae.</b>&mdash;Velata in which the membranes supported by the
  sheaves of spines are united so as to form a continuous supra-dorsal tent. The Pterasteridae are
  represented in British waters by a single species, <i>Pteraster militaris</i>, which is
  occasionally dredged in deep water off the British coast, and is found also in the Norwegian
  fjords and off the east coast of Canada. This interesting Starfish has five short, blunt arms, and
  its general appearance at first sight recalls that of <i>Asterina</i>. Closer inspection reveals
  the "false back." The anus is surrounded by five fan-like valves, supported by spines (Fig. 198),
  underneath which is a space in which the young complete their development, <i>Pteraster</i> being
  one of the genera in which the normal larval form is not developed. The tendency towards the union
  of adjacent spines by webs is deeply rooted in the organisation of the animal. It is seen on the
  under side where the spines borne by the ventral plates are united so as to form transverse combs.
  In <i>Hymenaster</i> (Fig. 199) the spines borne by the ventral plates are long and free.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order III. Paxillosa.</b></p>

  <p>This is an exceedingly well-marked order. The armature of the upper surface consists of
  paxillae. These organs as already mentioned are probably to be traced back to sheaves of spines
  like those of the Solasteridae. The same end as that striven after in the case of the Velata has
  been attained, but in a different way. The horizontal spinelets of the paxillae meet one another
  and form a close-fitting mail which is almost as efficient a protection as the webs and umbrellas
  of the Velata. Pedicellariae are occasionally present, but they are always of the pectinate or
  pincer variety, never forcipulate.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Archasteridae.</b>&mdash;Paxillosa in which the anus is still retained and in which
  the tube-feet have suckers.</p>

  <p>The Archasteridae are a most interesting family. Thus <i>Pararchaster</i> has no true paxillae,
  but only small isolated groups of spines. The pectinate pedicellariae are composed each of two
  parallel rows of somewhat smaller spines. The members of this family are to some extent
  intermediate in structure between the <span class="pagenum" id="page467"><span
  class="smaller">{467}</span></span>Spinulosa, such as Echinasteridae, and the other families of
  the Paxillosa&mdash;some genera, indeed, might almost be classed as Spinulosa. At the same time
  they are apparently closely allied with the more primitive Valvata such as <i>Astrogonium</i> and
  its allies, some of which have paxillae on the upper surface; although the retention of the anus
  and of the suckers on the tube-feet (in which characters they agree with the Archasteridae)
  distinguishes them from the more typical Paxillosa, in which both anus and suckers are lost.

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Astropectinidae.</b>&mdash;Paxillosa which have lost the anus, but which possess

  spinules and placed horizontally. The tube-feet have no suckers.</p>

  <p>This family is the only one of the order which occurs in British waters, where it is

  <p><i>Astropecten irregularis</i> is a very common species on the coast of Britain, and a study of
  its habits when in captivity has thrown a great deal of light on many obscure points in the
  anatomy of the Paxillosa. Owing to the loss of suckers it is unable to climb over rocks and stones
  like the ordinary species, but it runs over the surface of the hard sand in which it lives by
  means of its pointed tube-feet. The arms are highly muscular, and the animal when laid on its back
  rights itself by throwing the arms upwards and gradually overbalancing itself. The loss of suckers
  has also rendered <i>Astropecten</i> and its allies incapable of feeding in the manner described
  in the case of <i>Asterias rubens</i>. They are unable forcibly to open the valves of shell-fish,
  and the only resource left to them is to swallow their prey whole. The mouth is consequently wide,
  and the <span class="pagenum" id="page469"><span class="smaller">{469}</span></span>unfortunate

  <p>Many interesting experiments have been made on <i>Astropecten</i> by Preyer and other
  investigators, but one important fact<a id="NtA_457" href="#Nt_457"><sup>[457]</sup></a> has
  escaped their notice, that <i>Astropecten</i>, when at rest, lies buried in the sand, whilst the
  centre of the aboral surface is raised into a cone which projects above the surface. On the sides
  of this cone the few papulae which this species possesses are distributed. This raising of the
  aboral surface is obviously an expedient to facilitate respiration. It loosens the sand over the
  region of the papulae, and thus allows the water to have access to them. We can thus understand
  how the restriction of the papulae to the dorsal surface, so characteristic of the Paxillosa, is
  not always as Sladen imagined, a primitive characteristic, but often an adaptation to the
  burrowing habits which in all probability are characteristic of the whole order. In both
  <i>Luidia</i> and <i>Astropecten</i> Cu&eacute;not has described short spines covered with cilia in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page470"><span class="smaller">{470}</span></span>the interspaces between the
  marginal plates, these also subserve respiration by drawing a current of water over the gills.
  <i>Psilaster</i> (Fig. 202).</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Porcellanasteridae.</b>&mdash;Paxillosa which have lost the anus. There is a conical
  prominence in the centre of the dorsal surface termed the epiproctal cone, and in the interradial
  angles there are vertical grooves bordered by folds of membrane produced into papillae, the
  so-called "cribriform organs." The marginal plates are thin and form the vertical border of the
  thick disc. The tube-feet have no suckers.</p>

  <p>Comparing the Porcellanasteridae with the Astropectinidae we see at once that the "epiproctal
  cone" is a permanent representative of the temporary aboral elevation in <i>Astropecten</i>, and
  we are inclined to suspect that the cribriform organs are grooves lined with cilia which keep up a
  respiratory current like the ciliated <span class="pagenum" id="page471"><span
  class="smaller">{471}</span></span>spines of <i>Luidia</i>.  In all probability the
  Porcellanasteridae are more habitual burrowers than even the Astropectinidae.</p>

  and numerous feeble cribriform organs in each interradius, is found in deep water north of the
  Shetland Islands. <i>Porcellanaster</i> (Fig. 203) is a more typical genus, with one large
  cribriform organ in each interradius. <i>Hyphalaster</i> has long arms, on which the
  supero-marginal plates meet above.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order IV. Valvata.</b></p>

  <p>The Starfish included in this order are characterised by the absence of prominent spines and by
  the superficial covering of minute granules. The skeleton consists, in most cases, of plates, and
  these plates with their covering of granules probably represent the first stage in the evolution
  of paxillae.</p>

  <p>The tube-feet possess well-developed suckers. No members of this order can properly be said to
  be British.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Linckiidae.</b>&mdash;Valvata with long arms, the marginals being developed equally
  throughout the whole length. These Starfish are distinguished by their long narrow arms and small
  disc. It is possible that these forms, so different in many respects from the other families of
  the order, have been directly derived from the long-armed Echinasteridae. <i>Ophidiaster</i>,
  <i>Nardoa</i>, <i>Linckia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Pentagonasteridae.</b>&mdash;Valvata with short arms, the marginals being especially

  plates. <i>Pentagonaster</i> (Fig. 204), <i>Astrogonium</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Gymnasteridae.</b>&mdash;Valvata allied to the foregoing but distinguished by

  <i>Asteropsis</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Antheneidae.</b>&mdash;Valvata with short arms. The dorsal skeleton is reticulate

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Pentacerotidae.</b>&mdash;Valvata with arms of moderate length. The dorsal skeleton

  are smaller than the ventral ones.</p>

  <p>The Pentacerotidae include both short-armed and long-armed <span class="pagenum"
  id="page472"><span class="smaller">{472}</span></span>forms. Amongst the former is <i>Culcita</i>,

  </div>

  <p>The family Pentagonasteridae furnishes the key to the understanding of most of the forms
  contained in this order. It contains genera such as <i>Astrogonium</i> which possess on the back
  unmistakable paxillae, whilst on the under surface they have the characteristic covering of
  granules; these genera seem to be closely allied to the short-armed species of the Archasteridae,
  from which they are distinguished chiefly by the granular covering of the marginals. From a study
  of these cases it seems clear that the plates of the dorsal skeleton of the Valvata correspond to
  the supporting knobs of the paxillae much broadened out, and the granules correspond to the
  spinelets of the paxillae increased in number and diminished in size.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page473"><span class="smaller">{473}</span></span></div>

  <p class="sp3">As mentioned above, Ludwig has proved that the paxillae develop in the life-history

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order V. Forcipulata.</b></p>

  <p>This order, which includes the most highly developed members of the class Asteroidea, is at
  once distinguished by the possession of forcipulate pedicellariae which, as we have seen, possess
  a well-marked basal piece with which the two plates articulate. The pedicellariae are consequently
  sharply marked off from the spinelets, and no intermediate forms occur. The first conjoined
  adambulacrals, which in other orders form the "teeth" or mouth-angles, do not here project beyond
  the first pairs of ambulacral plates.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Asteriidae.</b>&mdash;Forcipulata in which the tube-feet are apparently arranged in
  four rows. Aboral skeleton a loose reticulum.</p>

  <p>The general features of the family Asteriidae have been explained in the description of
  <i>Asterias rubens</i> (p. <a href="#page432">432</a>). There are five well-marked species of the
  genus found on the British coasts. Of these <i>A. glacialis</i> is found chiefly in the
  south-western parts of the English Channel. It is a large Starfish of a purplish-grey colour, with
  large spines surrounded by cushions of pedicellariae arranged in one or two rows down each arm.
  <i>A. muelleri</i> resembles the foregoing species, but is of much smaller size, and is further
  distinguished by having straight pedicellariae in the neighbourhood of the ambulacral groove only.
  It is found on the east coast of Scotland, and carries its comparatively large eggs about with it
  until development is completed. <i>A. rubens</i> is the commonest species, and is found on both
  east and west coasts. Its colour is a bright orange, but varies to almost a straw colour. It is at
  once distinguished from the foregoing species by the spines of the dorsal surface, which are small
  and numerous, an irregular line of somewhat larger ones being sometimes seen down the centre of
  each arm. <i>A. murrayi</i> is a peculiar species restricted to the west coast of Scotland and
  Ireland. It has flattened arms, with vertical sides, and only three rows of small spines on the
  dorsal surface. It is of a violet colour. <i>A. hispida</i> is also a western species. It is a
  <span class="pagenum" id="page474"><span class="smaller">{474}</span></span>small Starfish with
  short stout arms; there are no straight pedicellariae, and only a few sharp spines on the dorsal
  surface.</p>

  <p>On the eastern coast of North America there are several species of <i>Asterias</i>, of which
  the most noteworthy is the 6-rayed <i>A. polaris</i> of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. This species
  exhibits a marvellous range of colour-variation, ranging from bluish-violet through purple to red
  and straw-coloured. This variation seems to show that colour, as such, is of no importance to the
  animal, but probably depends on some compound of slightly varying composition which is being
  carried by the amoebocytes towards the exterior. On the Pacific coast there is a rich fauna of
  Starfish, among which we may mention as members of this family <i>Asterias ochracea</i>, a large
  violet species, so strong that it requires a severe wrench to detach it from the rock, and
  <i>Pycnopodia</i> with twenty-two arms.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Heliasteridae.</b>&mdash;Forcipulata allied to the Asteriidae, but with very
  numerous arms and double interradial septa. <i>Heliaster.</i></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Zoroasteridae.</b>&mdash;Forcipulata with the tube-feet in four rows at the base of
  the arm, in two rows at the tip. Aboral skeleton of almost contiguous plates bearing small spines
  or flattened scales. <i>Zoroaster</i>, <i>Pholidaster</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Stichasteridae.</b>&mdash;Forcipulata with the tube-feet in four rows. Aboral
  skeleton of almost contiguous plates covered with granules. <i>Stichaster</i>,
  <i>Tarsaster</i>.</p>

  <p>The Stichasteridae and Zoroasteridae have acquired a superficial resemblance to some of the
  long-armed Valvata, from which they are at once distinguished by their pedicellariae. It would be
  exceedingly interesting if more could be found out concerning the normal environment of these
  animals; it might then be possible to discover what is the cause of the assumption of this uniform
  mail of plates.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Pedicellasteridae.</b>&mdash;Forcipulata with two rows of tube-feet. The aboral
  skeleton bears projecting spines surrounded by cushions of straight pedicellariae.
  <i>Pedicellaster</i>, <i>Coronaster</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Brisingidae.</b>&mdash;Forcipulata with numerous arms and only two rows of
  tube-feet. Aboral skeleton largely rudimentary and confined to the base of the arms. The small
  blunt spines are contained in sacs of skin covered with pedicellariae.</p>

  <p>The Brisingidae, including <i>Brisinga</i> and <i>Odinia</i>, are a very <span class="pagenum"
  id="page475"><span class="smaller">{475}</span></span>remarkable family, chiefly on account of the
  smallness of the disc and of the extraordinary length of the arms. The arms have what we must
  consider to have been the primitive arrangement, since there is no lateral adhesion between them,
  and interbrachial septa are consequently entirely absent. The reduction of the skeleton is a very
  marked peculiarity and, like the tendency to the reduction of the skeleton of deep-sea fish, may
  stand in some relation to the great pressure under which the animals live.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Fossil Asteroidea.</b></p>

  <p>The Asteroidea occur somewhat plentifully as fossils. In the Lower Jurassic <i>Asterias</i>,
  <i>Astropecten</i>, <i>Luidia</i>, <i>Solaster</i>, and <i>Goniaster</i> have already made their
  appearance. In the Cretaceous <span class="pagenum" id="page476"><span
  class="smaller">{476}</span></span><i>Pentaceros</i> appears. In the older rocks occur a number of
  forms of different character from any now existing. Of these <i>Aspidosoma</i> (Fig. 206), with
  short lancet-shaped arms sharply distinguished from the disc and continued along its under
  surface, seems to be intermediate between Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea. The skeleton of the arm is
  composed of alternating ambulacral ossicles bordered by adambulacral ossicles, which are at the
  same time marginals and sharply distinguished from the marginals forming the edge of the disc.
  <i>Palaeaster</i>, on the other hand, is a true Asteroid; there are marginals distinct from the
  adambulacrals, but the disc is reduced to its smallest dimensions, there being only one plate on
  the ventral side of each interradius. There are a number of genera (<i>Palaeocoma</i>, for
  instance) with a large disc and very short arms and very shallow ambulacral grooves; all have
  alternating ambulacral plates. Some genera appear to have had the madreporite on the ventral
  surface of an interradius. On the other hand, in the Devonian occurs <i>Xenaster</i>, which was a
  fairly normal Asteroid, with pavement-like marginals, deep ambulacral grooves, and broad arms.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS II. OPHIUROIDEA</p>

  <p>The second class of Eleutherozoa are familiarly known as "Brittle Stars," on account of their
  tendency, when seized, to escape by snapping off an arm, although this habit is by no means
  confined to them, but is shared in a marked degree by many Asteroidea, such as <i>Luidia</i>, for
  instance. Like the Asteroidea, they are "starfish," that is to say, they consist of a disc and of
  arms radiating from it; but the scientific name Ophiuroidea really expresses the great dominating
  feature of their organisation. Literally it signifies "Snake-tail" (<span title="ophis"
  class="fsn">&#x1F44;&phi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, snake; <span title="oura"
  class="fsn">&omicron;&#x1F50;&rho;&#x03AC;</span>, tail), and thus vividly describes the
  wriggling, writhing movements of the long thin arms, by means of which the Ophiuroid climbs in and
  out of the crevices between the stones and gravel in which it lives. This feature, viz. the
  effecting of movement by means of muscular jerks of the arms, instead of by the slow protrusion
  and retraction of the tube-feet, is the key to the understanding of most of the points wherein the
  Brittle Stars differ from the true Starfish.</p>

  <p>Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea agree in the common ground-plan of their structure, that is, they
  both possess arms; but the most obvious difference in their outer appearance is that whereas in
  Asteroidea the arms merge insensibly into the disc, in Ophiuroidea the disc is circular in outline
  and is sharply marked off from the arms. Closer inspection shows that in the Ophiuroid the arms
  are continued inwards along grooves, which run on the under surface of the disc, and that they
  finally coalesce to form a buccal framework surrounding the mouth. In <span class="pagenum"
  id="page478"><span class="smaller">{478}</span></span>the very young Ophiuroid the arms melt into
  a small central disc, as in the Starfish, but the disc of the adult is made up of a series of
  interradial dorsal outgrowths which meet one another above the arms.</p>

  <p>One of the commonest British Ophiuroids is <i>Ophiothrix fragilis</i> (Figs. 207, 208), which
  is found in swarms in shallow water off the west coast of England and Scotland. We may therefore
  select it as the type, and, since the <b>arm</b> is the most characteristic organ of an Ophiuroid,
  we may commence by studying it. Speaking generally, an Ophiuroid either drags itself forward by
  two arms and pushes itself by the other three (Fig. 207),<a id="NtA_458"
  href="#Nt_458"><sup>[458]</sup></a> or else it drags itself by one and pushes with the other four
  (Fig. 217). The arms during this process are bent into characteristic curves, by the straightening
  of which in the posterior arms the animal is pushed onwards, whilst the intensification of these
  curves in the anterior arms causes the animal to be dragged forwards. The grip of the arm on the
  substratum is chiefly in the distal portion of the curve. The alteration of the curvature is due
  to the contraction of the muscles on one side of the arms. There is no ambulacral groove such as
  is found on the under side of the arms of all Asteroidea, for the arm is completely ensheathed by
  four series of plates, an upper row of dorsal plates, an under row of ventral plates, and two
  lateral rows of lateral plates. The last named, which in all probability correspond to the
  adambulacral plates of Starfish, bear each a transverse row of seven spines with roughened
  surfaces; these enable the animal to get a grip on the substratum over which it moves. The podia
  in Ophiuroidea are termed "tentacles"; they are totally devoid of suckers, being simple conical
  papillae used as sense-organs, and are of little, if any, service in locomotion. They issue from
  openings called "tentacle-pores" situated between the edges of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page480"><span class="smaller">{480}</span></span>ventral and lateral plates, guarded each by
  a valve-like plate called the "tentacle-scale." In <i>Ophiothrix</i> they are covered with
  sense-organs, each consisting of a hillock-like elevation of the ectoderm, in which are cells
  carrying long stiff sense-hairs. In most Ophiuroids such organs are not present, though abundant
  scattered sense-cells occur, and the outer surface of the tube-feet and the lining of certain
  pockets called "genital bursae" (Fig. 208, <i>g.b</i>) are the only portions of the surface where
  the ectoderm persists. Everywhere else, although present in the young, it disappears, leaving as
  remnants a few nuclei here and there attached to the under side of the cuticle.<a id="NtA_459"

  <p>The greater part of the section of the arm is occupied by a disc-like ossicle called the
  "vertebra." Each vertebra articulates with its predecessor and successor by cup-and-ball joints,
  and it is connected to each of them by four powerful longitudinal muscles. Above, its outline is
  notched by a groove, in which lies an extension of the coelom of the disc (Fig. 209, <i>coe</i>),
  but contains no outgrowth of the alimentary canal, as is the case in Asteroidea. The vertebra is
  also grooved below, and in this lower groove are contained the radial water-vascular canal <span
  class="pagenum" id="page481"><span class="smaller">{481}</span></span>(Fig. 209, <i>w.v.r</i>),
  and below it perihaemal canals as in Asteroidea; below this again the radial nerve-cord
  (<i>L</i>), and beneath this again a canal called the "epineural canal" (<i>ep</i>), which
  represents the missing ambulacral groove. This canal in the very young Brittle Star is an open
  groove, but becomes closed by the approximation of its edges. The vertebra, which has a double
  origin, represents a pair of fused ambulacral ossicles. In <i>Ophiohelus</i> these are only
  slightly adherent to one another (Fig. 216).</p>

      of the vertebra. <i>v.g</i>, Ventral groove.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When the surface of a vertebra is examined it is found that it can be divided into a thin
  border, to which are attached the four muscles by which it is connected to its successor and
  predecessor, and a central portion, on which are situated the knobs and pits, by means of which it
  articulates with the next vertebra.</p>

  <p>The simultaneous contraction of the two upper muscles causes the arm to bend upwards. The
  contraction of the two lower bend it downwards, whilst a sideward movement is effected by the
  contraction of the upper and lower muscle of the same side. On the proximal surface of the central
  portion of the vertebra there is a central knob and two ventro-lateral knobs, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page482"><span class="smaller">{482}</span></span>a median ventral pit and two
  dorso-lateral pits, and on the distal surface there are pits corresponding to the knobs on the
  proximal side and <i>vice versa</i> (Fig. 210, C). These knobs and pits restrict the movement of
  one vertebra on the next, so that although the arms can undergo an unlimited amount of flexion
  from side to side, they cannot be rolled up in the vertical plane. When the under surface of the
  vertebra is examined there is seen on each side of the central groove two round holes, a distal
  and a proximal. The distal pair are for the passage of the canals connecting the radial
  water-vessel with the tentacles, these canals traversing the substance of the vertebra for a part
  of their course; the proximal pair are for nerves going to the longitudinal muscles, which
  likewise perforate part of the ventral border of the vertebra.</p>

  <p>In order to understand the anomalous circumstance that the canals going to the tentacles
  actually perforate the vertebrae, it must be clearly borne in mind that the basis of the body-wall
  in all Echinoderms is a mass of jelly with amoebocytes in it, to which we must assign the power of
  secreting carbonate of lime, and all we have to assume in the case of Ophiuroids is that
  calcification spread outwards from the original ambulacral ossicles into the surrounding jelly,
  enclosing any organs that happened to traverse it.</p>

  <p>When the ossicles of the arm are followed inwards towards the <b>mouth</b>, they are seen to
  undergo a profound modification, so as to form, by union with the corresponding ossicles of
  adjacent arms, a structure called the mouth-frame. The general character of this modification is
  similar to that affecting the first ambulacral and adambulacral ossicles in the arms of an
  Asteroid, but in the Ophiuroid the change is much more profound. The first apparent vertebra
  consists of two separated halves, and each is fused with the first adambulacral (lateral) plate,
  which in turn is firmly united with the corresponding plate in the adjoining arm. Thus is formed
  the "jaw," as the projection is called. The extensions of the mouth-cavity between adjacent jaws
  are termed "mouth-angles." To the apex of each jaw is attached a plate bearing a vertical row of
  seven short blunt spines called "teeth" (Fig. 212, <i>p</i>). The plate is called the "torus
  angularis" (Fig. 211, <i>T</i>), and on its ventral edge there is a tuft of spines which are
  termed "tooth-papillae" (Fig. 208, <i>t.p</i>). On the upper aspect of the jaw <span
  class="pagenum" id="page483"><span class="smaller">{483}</span></span>are a pair of plates termed
  "peristomial plates." These discs&mdash;of which there are two in each radius, one on each jaw
  which flanks the radius&mdash;possibly represent the separated halves of the first vertebra, the
  apparent first vertebra being really the second. On the flank of the jaw there is dorsally a
  groove for the water-vascular ring and nerve-ring (Fig. 212, <i>n.r</i>), and beneath this a
  groove for the first tentacle and a pore for the second, both of which spring directly from the
  ring-canal; below these, in most Ophiuroidea, but not in <i>Ophiothrix</i>, there is a row of
  blunt triangular spines called "mouth-papillae" (Fig. 212, <i>p<sup>1</sup></i>).</p>

  <p>The words "jaw" and "tooth" are misleading. There is no evidence that the jaws of a Brittle
  Star are ever used for crushing food, but by means of the muscles attaching them to the first
  <span class="pagenum" id="page484"><span class="smaller">{484}</span></span>complete vertebra in
  the arm they can be rotated downwards so as greatly to enlarge the mouth, and again rotated
  upwards and inwards, when they form an excellent strainer to prevent the entrance of coarse
  particles. To permit this extensive movement the articulatory facets on the proximal surface of
  the first vertebra have been much modified; the median knob and pit have disappeared, and the
  dorso-lateral pits are raised on to the surface of processes, so that there are in all four
  processes, two of which articulate with one half of a jaw.</p>

  <p>The mouth can be narrowed and the jaws forced inwards towards the centre by the simultaneous
  contraction of five muscles (<i>musc. tr</i>, Fig. 213) each, which unite the two halves of a
  jaw.</p>

  <p>Turning now to the skeleton of the <b>disc</b>, we notice that dorsally it consists of a
  closely-fitting mosaic of small plates, which are usually concealed from view by a covering of
  minute spines. Opposite the insertion of each arm there are, however, a pair of large triangular
  plates ("radials"), which extend outwards to the periphery and strengthen it, much as the ribs do
  in an umbrella. These radial plates are always exposed, in <i>Ophiothrix</i>, even when the rest
  of the dorsal plates are concealed by spines. On the under surface there is a similar plating; but
  adjoining the jaws are five large, more or less rhomboidal, plates <span class="pagenum"
  id="page485"><span class="smaller">{485}</span></span>termed "scuta buccalia" (Fig. 211,
  <i>J<sub>1</sub></i>), on one of which open the few madreporic pores which the animal possesses.
  Attached to the sides of the scuta buccalia are the "lateral mouth shields," which are in fact the
  adambulacral plates belonging to the second pair of ambulacral plates which form the main mass of
  the jaws. Further out, on the under side of the disc, there is, on each side of each arm, a long
  narrow slit&mdash;the opening of the genital bursa (Fig. 208, <i>g.b</i>), so that there are ten
  genital bursae. The "genital bursa" (Fig. 214) is a sac lined by ciliated ectoderm projecting into
  the interior of the disc. It is called genital because the openings of the genital organs are
  situated on its surface; its main function, however, is respiratory, the cilia bringing about a
  constant inward current of fresh sea-water, the oxygen contained in which diffuses through the
  thin wall of the sac into the coelomic fluid. The opening of the bursa is strengthened on its
  radial side by a rod-like ossicle, the "genital plate," and on its interradial side by an ossicle
  called the "genital scale" (Fig. 212, <i>gen</i>), and in <i>Ophiothrix</i> the outer end of the
  radial plate articulates with the outer end of the genital plate. Muscles connect the two plates
  running on either side of the articulation.</p>

  <p>Observations on <i>Ophiothrix</i><a id="NtA_460" href="#Nt_460"><sup>[460]</sup></a> show that
  in this species at any rate the radial plates can be raised or lowered. When they are raised the
  centre of the disc is lifted into a cone and water is sucked into the genital bursae, whereas when
  they are lowered the bursae are compressed and water is expelled. This forced respiration appears
  to come into play when the supply of oxygen is getting scanty.</p>

  <p>The <b>alimentary canal</b> of <i>Ophiothrix</i> is a simple flattened sac (Fig. 213). It is
  devoid of an anus and cannot be everted through the mouth. There is a horizontal pouch given off
  into each interradial lobe of the disc. The sac is attached to the dorsal wall of the coelom by
  numerous mesenteries, fibrous cords traversing the coelomic cavity and clothed on the outer side
  by coelomic epithelium. To the mouth-frame it is attached by a circular membrane, which we have
  reason for believing is a <span class="pagenum" id="page486"><span
  class="smaller">{486}</span></span>functionless remnant of the retractor muscles of the stomach of
  Asteroidea. In the young Asteroid there is a similar sheet of membrane, which later becomes
  resolved into the ten retractor bands.</p>

  <p>The simple structure of the alimentary canal appears to be correlated with the exceedingly
  simple character of the food. <i>Ophiothrix</i> feeds on the most superficial layer of mud at the
  bottom of the sea. This deposit consists partly of microscopic Algae and partly of decaying
  organic matter, and is much more easily disposed of than the living animals on which the Starfish
  preys. The food is shovelled into the mouth by the first two or "buccal" pairs of tube-feet in
  each ray.</p>

  <p>The <b>water-vascular system</b> has undergone a most interesting set of modifications, which
  can be explained by noticing the fact that the tube-feet have almost, if not quite, lost their
  locomotor function and are now used as tactile organs. The ampulla, or swollen inner end of the
  tube-foot, has disappeared, and the upper end of the organ is directly connected with the radial
  canal by means of a curved canal, which traverses the outermost flange of the vertebra, appearing
  on its <span class="pagenum" id="page487"><span class="smaller">{487}</span></span>surface in a
  groove on the outer side of the dorsal lateral knob on the distal side of the ossicle. As in
  Asteroidea there are valves, which regulate the entrance of fluid into the tube-foot. The
  stone-canal is a curved tube of simple circular section and excessively narrow bore which extends
  from the water-vascular ring <i>downwards</i> to the madreporite (Fig. 213, <i>mp</i>) situated on
  one of the scuta buccalia. The madreporite, in <i>Ophiothrix</i> as in most Brittle Stars, is an
  exceedingly rudimentary structure, consisting of one or two pores leading into as many
  pore-canals. From each interradius, except that in which the stone-canal lies, a large Polian
  vesicle hangs down from the water-vascular ring into the coelom.</p>

  <p>We saw that in the Asteroid the ampulla was used like the bulb of a pipette to force the fluid
  in the tube-foot down into the tip, so as to press the sucker against the substratum. But when the
  tube-foot is used as a sense-organ, a few circular fibres around its upper end suffice to bring
  about all the extension that is needed. Since the extension is no longer a very vigorous act, the
  loss of fluid by transudation has probably been rendered insignificant, and hence the stone-canal
  and madreporite, whose function it is to repair the loss, have been reduced in size. The curious
  ventral curvature of the stone-canal is, however, due to another cause. In the very young
  Ophiuroid the madreporite is on the edge of the disc, and the stone-canal extends horizontally
  outwards; and in some Asteroidea there is a similar outward direction in its course. As
  development proceeds the dorsal interradial areas of the disc of the young Ophiuroid grow out into
  lobes, building up the conspicuous adult disc and forcing the madreporite, and with it the
  stone-canal, downwards towards the ventral surface.</p>

  <p>The pores of the madreporite in <i>Ophiothrix</i>, like some of those in the Asteroid, open not
  directly into the stone-canal but into the <b>axial sinus</b> (Fig. 213, <i>ax</i>). This is a
  large ovoid sac, lined with thin epithelium, lying between the stone-canal and the mouth-frame,
  since of course it has shared in the ventral rotation of the stone-canal. Its open connexion with
  the stone-canal was easily recognised by Ludwig, who termed it, on this account, the "ampulla."<a
  id="NtA_461" href="#Nt_461"><sup>[461]</sup></a> The name "axial sinus" was bestowed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page488"><span class="smaller">{488}</span></span>mistakenly on another
  cavity, which will be mentioned in connexion with the genital organs.</p>

  <p>The radial <b>perihaemal spaces</b> of the arms open into a "perihaemal ring" representing the
  outer perihaemal ring of Asteroids; but the axial sinus does not have any such extension as
  constitutes the inner perihaemal ring in Starfish. So-called oral circular and radial <b>blood
  strands</b> are to be found in similar positions to the corresponding structures in
  <i>Asteroidea</i>.</p>

  <p>The <b>nervous system</b> might have been expected to have become very much modified, since the
  activities of the Brittle Stars are so different from those of the Starfish. It is indeed a
  universal rule in the Animal Kingdom that, concomitantly with the increase in size and activity of
  a muscle, there is a corresponding increase in the number of ganglion-cells which control it. An
  accurate radial section of an arm shows that there is, corresponding to the interspaces between
  the two vertebrae, a ganglionic swelling of the nerve-cord. As in Asteroids, there are not only
  ectodermic ganglion-cells on the under surface of the cord abutting on the epineural canal, but
  also coelomic ganglion-cells derived from the floor of the radial perihaemal canal. Both these
  categories of cells are largely increased in number in the ganglion. From the dorsal-cells arise a
  pair of large nerves which pass directly up and supply the great intervertebral muscles. From the
  interspace between the ganglia a direct prolongation of the ventral part of the nerve-cord, the
  so-called pedal nerve, extends out along the side of the tentacle, as in Asteroids. In Ophiuroids
  it swells out into a ganglion, completely surrounding the tentacle and giving off nerves to the
  surfaces of the arm which terminate in the cuticle.</p>

  <p>There is a large ganglion where the radial cord joins the nerve-ring, and, owing to the more
  specialised condition of the nervous system, a severed arm in an Ophiuroid is much more helpless
  than an arm of an Asteroid. It will not carry out "escape movements," and is for a long time rigid
  under the shock of section; at last it simply gives reflex movements on stimulation.</p>

  <p>Preyer<a id="NtA_462" href="#Nt_462"><sup>[462]</sup></a> endeavoured to test the
  "intelligence" of Ophiuroids by observing how they would adapt themselves to circumstances which
  it might be fairly assumed they had never encountered <span class="pagenum" id="page489"><span
  class="smaller">{489}</span></span>in their ordinary experience. To this end he passed over the
  arm of a specimen a piece of indiarubber tubing, which clung to it tightly. He found that the
  animal first tried walking off, pressing the encumbered arm against the ground, so that the piece
  of tubing was rubbed off. It was then replaced more tightly than before; the animal, having tried
  the first method without result, waved the arm to and fro in the water till the rubber floated
  off. In a third experiment the animal held the rubber against the ground by a neighbouring arm,
  and drew the encumbered arm out. When the rubber was replaced a fourth time, the animal kicked it
  off by alternately pressing neighbouring arms against it. Finally, when the rubber was put on so
  firmly that all the above-mentioned methods failed, the arm was broken off. Preyer concludes from
  this that Ophiuroids have a high degree of intelligence; but this may be doubted, and the reader
  is referred to the account of Uexk&uuml;ll's experiments given in the next chapter. There is, however,
  no doubt at all that Ophiuroidea are by far the most active of all Echinoderms, and one would
  naturally correlate this with higher psychic development.</p>

  <p>The radial nerve ends in a terminal tentacle sheltered by a median plate at the end of the arm;
  but eyes, such as are found in Asteroids, are wanting, and the animal does not appear to be
  sensitive to light.</p>

  <p>The <b>reproductive system</b> in Ophiuroids consists of a genital stolon giving rise at its
  distal end to a genital rachis, which extends in a circular course round the disc, ensheathed in
  an "aboral sinus" (Fig. 213, <i>ab</i>) and swelling out so as to form the gonads (testes or
  ovaries), where it passes over the inner side of the genital bursae. The genital stolon (Fig. 213,
  <i>gen.st</i>) is a compact ovoid organ, often termed on account of its shape the "ovoid gland."
  It is situated close to the stone-canal, and, as in Starfish, it indents the outer wall of the
  axial sinus; but, unlike the stolon of the Asteroid, it is separated from the general coelom by a
  space, of which it forms the inner wall, but whose outer wall is formed by a sheet of membrane.
  This cavity must be carefully distinguished from the axial sinus of Asteroidea, to which it was
  supposed at one time to correspond; it is really formed by a pocket-like ingrowth of the general
  coelom into the septum dividing it from the axial sinus. The cells forming the inner side of this
  pocket form the primitive germ-cells, which <span class="pagenum" id="page490"><span
  class="smaller">{490}</span></span>constitute the main mass of the ovoid gland; those of the outer
  side remain thin. The cavity of the ingrowth is shut off from the general coelom, but persists
  throughout life. In Asteroids a similar ingrowth takes place, but both walls thicken and become
  converted into germ cells, and the cavity disappears, and, as in Asteroidea, a considerable number
  of the germ-cells in the stolon degenerate.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The genital rachis (Fig. 213, <i>gen.r</i>) is an outgrowth of the distal end of
  the genital stolon, which extends in a complete circle round the disc. The rachis does not,
  however, lie everywhere in the same plane, but by its undulating course bears witness to the
  distortion which the disc has undergone. In the radii it is, as in the Asteroid, dorsal; but in
  the interradii it is ventral, this ventral portion having, like stone-canal and axial sinus, been
  carried down by the preponderant growth of the dorsal parts of the disc. It is everywhere
  ensheathed by the aboral sinus, which, as in Asteroids, is an outgrowth of the coelom. The rachis
  is embedded in a strand of modified connective tissue, to which we may (as in the case of
  <i>Asterias</i>) apply the name "aboral blood-ring." Both on the central and peripheral sides of
  this sinus are vertical muscles connecting the genital and the radial plates, which bring about
  the respiratory movements already referred to. Just above the madreporite, at the end of the
  genital stolon, is a small, completely closed space, which by its position corresponds with the
  madreporic vesicle of Asteroids and represents the right hydrocoel (Fig. 213, <i>mv</i>). As the
  rachis passes over the genital bursa it gives off branches, which swell up to form the genital
  organs. In <i>Ophiothrix</i> there is <span class="pagenum" id="page491"><span
  class="smaller">{491}</span></span>one such organ on each side of each bursa, but in other genera
  (cf. <i>Ophiarachna</i>) a large number of small ones. The genital products are shed into the
  water through the bursae.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Classification of Ophiuroidea.</b></p>

  <p>Before proceeding to study the classification of Brittle Stars, it is necessary to give some
  account of the range of structure met with in the group.</p>

  <p><b>Number of Radii.</b>&mdash;The number of arms is rarely increased, and hardly ever exceeds
  six; a few species (each an isolated one in its genus) have six arms, and in one case
  (<i>Ophiactis virens</i>), at any rate, this is associated with the power of transverse fission.
  In many Cladophiurae the arms fork repeatedly, so that although there are only five radii, there
  is quite a crowd of terminal branches.</p>

  <p><b>Vertebrae.</b>&mdash;The vertebrae differ in the manner in which they articulate with one
  another. In <i>Ophiothrix fragilis</i> taken as the type, which in this respect resembles the vast
  majority of species (Zygophiurae), the knobs and pits on the faces of the vertebrae prevent the
  arms from being coiled in the vertical plane. In <i>Ophioteresis</i> (Fig. 210, A) and some allied
  genera (Streptophiurae) the knobs are almost obsolete, and the arms are free to coil in the
  vertical plane; whilst in <i>Gorgonocephalus</i> and <i>Astrophyton</i> (Cladophiurae) the arms
  are repeatedly branched and the vertebrae have saddle-shaped articulating surfaces, so that they
  have quite a snake-like capacity for coiling themselves round external objects. In
  <i>Ophiohelus</i> (Fig. 216) each vertebra consists of two rod-like plates placed parallel with
  the long axis of the arm and fused at both ends, but divergent in the middle, leaving a hole
  between them.</p>

  <p><b>Covering Plates of the Arms.</b>&mdash;The upper arm-plates are the most variable. They may
  be surrounded by small supplementary plates (<i>Ophiopholis</i>) or double (<i>Ophioteresis</i>).
  In all (?) Cladophiurae and most Streptophiurae they are absent, being replaced by minute
  calcareous granules. Under arm-plates are absent in <i>Ophioteresis</i> and in the distal portion
  of the arms in many Cladophiurae. Side arm-plates are constantly present, and in most Cladophiurae
  meet in the middle line below.</p>

  <p><b>Arm-Spines.</b>&mdash;The spines borne by the lateral covering plates of the arms vary
  greatly in character. In <i>Ophiura</i> and its <span class="pagenum" id="page492"><span
  class="smaller">{492}</span></span>allies they are short and smooth, and are borne by the hinder
  edge of the arm and directed backwards; but in the larger number of genera they are borne nearer
  the centre of the plate, and are directed outwards at right angles to the arm. They may be covered
  by small asperities, as in <i>Ophiothrix</i> (Fig. 215, C), when they are said to be rough; or
  these asperities may become secondary spines, as in <i>Ophiacantha</i> (Fig. 215, B), when they
  are said to be thorny. In <i>Ophiopteron</i> all the spines borne by a single plate are united by
  a web of skin so as to constitute a swimming organ. The small plates guarding the ends of the
  tentacles (tentacle-scales) may be absent, or more rarely double. In Cladophiurae there is a
  regular transition from tentacle-scale to arm-spine; the tentacle-scale being merely the smallest
  of the series of lateral spines.</p>

  <p>True <b>pedicellariae</b> are unknown amongst Ophiuroidea, since there is no longer a soft
  ectoderm to protect, but in some cases, as for instance in <i>Ophiohelus</i>, small hooks movable
  on a basal piece attached to the arms are found which may represent the vestiges of such organs
  (Fig. 216). Similar hooks are found in the young <i>Ophiothrix fragilis</i> just after
  metamorphosis and in all Cladophiurae, replacing in the latter case the arm-spines in the distal
  portion of the arm.</p>

      <i>Ophiothrix</i>, &times; 6. (After Lyman.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Mouth-Frame.</b>&mdash;In its broad outlines there is practically no variation in this organ
  throughout the group, but in respect of <span class="pagenum" id="page493"><span
  class="smaller">{493}</span></span>the spines, which are borne on the flanks of the jaws
  (mouth-papillae) and on their apices (teeth and tooth-papillae) there is very great variation.
  Teeth are always present. Mouth-papillae are very frequently present, tooth-papillae are rarer,
  and it is only in a restricted number of genera (<i>Ophiocoma</i> and its allies) that both
  mouth-papillae and tooth-papillae are present at the same time.</p>

      side-plates bear a row of movable hooks which articulate with basal outgrowths of the plate.
      (After Lyman.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><b>Skeleton of the Disc.</b>&mdash;This is typically composed of a mosaic of plates of
  different sizes, but in some cases (<i>Ophiomyxa</i>, most Streptophiurae, and Cladophiurae)
  these, with the exception of the radials and genitals, are entirely absent, and the disc is then
  quite soft and covered with a columnar epithelium, the persistent ectoderm. Even the scuta
  buccalia may disappear. Radial shields are absent in <i>Ophiohelus</i>. In many cases
  (<i>Ophiothrix</i> and <i>Ophiocoma</i>) all the dorsal plates except the radials are concealed
  from view by a covering of small spines. In some genera (<i>Ophiopyrgus</i>) there are five large
  plates in the centre of the upper part of the disc, which have been termed "calycinals" from a
  mistaken comparison with the plates forming the cup or calyx of the Pelmatozoa, but there is no
  connexion between the two sets of structures.</p>

  <p>The <b>madreporite</b> is usually quite rudimentary, but in Cladophiurae there may be five
  madreporites, each with about 200 pores, and, of course, five stone-canals.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page494"><span class="smaller">{494}</span></span></div>

  <p>The number of <b>genital organs</b> varies very much. In the small <i>Amphiura squamata</i>
  there are two gonads, an ovary and a testis, attached to each bursa, but in the larger species
  there may be very many more.</p>

  <p>We follow Bell's classification,<a id="NtA_463" href="#Nt_463"><sup>[463]</sup></a> according
  to which the Ophiuroidea are divided, according to the manner in which the vertebrae move on one
  another (cf. Fig. 210), into three main orders, since these movements are of prime importance in
  their lives.</p>

  <p>(1) <span class="sc">Streptophiurae</span>, in which the faces of the vertebrae have
  rudimentary knobs and corresponding depressions, so that the arms can be coiled in the vertical
  plane. These are regarded as the most primitive of Ophiuroidea.</p>

  <p>(2) <span class="sc">Zygophiurae</span>, in which the vertebral faces have knobs and pits which
  prevent their coiling in a vertical plane.</p>

  <p class="sp3">(3) <span class="sc">Cladophiurae</span>, in which the arms can be coiled as in (1)
  and are in most cases forked. No teeth; the arm-spines are papillae, the covering plates of the
  arms are reduced to granules.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Streptophiurae.</b></p>

  <p>This is not a very well defined order; it includes a few genera intermediate in character
  between the Cladophiurae and the Zygophiurae, and believed to be the most primitive Ophiuroids
  living. It is not divided into families. The vertebrae have rudimentary articulating surfaces,
  there being two low bosses and corresponding hollows on each side, and so they are capable of
  being moved in a vertical plane, as in the Cladophiurae; the arms never branch, and further, they
  always bear arm-spines and lateral arm-plates at least. No species of this order are found on the
  British coast, but <i>Ophiomyxa pentagona</i>, in which the dorsal part of the disc is represented
  only by soft skin, is common in the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Ophioteresis</i> is devoid of ventral plates on the arms, and appears to possess
  an open ambulacral groove, though this point has not been tested in sections. <i>Ophiohelus</i>
  and <i>Ophiogeron</i> have vertebrae in which traces of the double origin persist (see p. <a
  href="#page491">491</a>).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page495"><span class="smaller">{495}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Zygophiurae.</b></p>

  <p>This group includes all the common and better-known British forms. They are divided into five
  families, all of which are represented in British waters.</p>

  <p>This family includes all the Brittle Stars of smooth porcelanous aspect and provided with only
  short spines. Forbes<a id="NtA_465" href="#Nt_465"><sup>[465]</sup></a> called them Sand-stars,
  since their short spines render these animals incapable of burrowing or of climbing well, and
  hence they appear to move comparatively rapidly over firm ground, sand, gravel, or muddy sand, and
  they are active enough to be able to capture small worms and Crustacea. The prey is seized by
  coiling one of the arms around it.</p>

  <p>One genus, <i>Ophiura</i>, is fairly common round the British coast, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page497"><span class="smaller">{497}</span></span>being represented by <i>O. ciliaris</i> and
  <i>O. albida</i>; the former is the commoner. An allied species dredged by H.M.S. "Challenger" is
  represented in Figs. 217 and 218.</p>

  <p><i>Ophiomusium</i> (Fig. 219) is a very peculiar genus. The mouth-papillae on each side of each
  mouth-angle are confluent, forming a razor-like projection on each side of each mouth-angle (Fig.
  220). The arms are short, and the podia are only developed at the bases of the arms.
  <i>Ophiopyrgus</i> has the dorsal surface raised into a conical elevation protected by a central
  plate surrounded by five large plates.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In the remaining four families the arms are inserted on the under surface of the disc; in other
  words, the interradial lobes which make up the disc have completely coalesced dorsally; and the
  spines stand out at right angles to the arm.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Amphiuridae.</b>&mdash;Mouth-papillae present, but no tooth-papillae; radial shields

  <p>The most interesting Brittle Star belonging to this family is <i>Amphiura squamata</i>
  (<i>elegans</i>), a small form, with a disc about &frac14; inch in diameter covered with naked plates. It
  is hermaphrodite and viviparous, the young completing their development inside the bursae of the
  mother. Occasionally the whole disc, with the exception of the mouth-frame, is thrown off and
  regenerated. This appears to be a device to enable the young to escape. Three other species of
  <i>Amphiura</i> are found in British waters.</p>

  <p><i>Ophiactis</i> is another genus belonging to this family, distinguished from <i>Amphiura</i>
  by its shorter arms and smoother arm-spines. It lives in the interstices of hard gravel. The
  British species, <i>O. balli</i>, presents no special features of interest, but the Neapolitan
  <i>O. virens</i> is an extraordinary form. It has six arms, three of which are usually larger than
  the other three, for it is always undergoing a process of transverse division, each half

  numerous long-stalked Polian-vesicles in each interradius, and in addition a number of long

  <p>These, like the Streptophiurae, have the power of rolling the arms in a vertical plane, but the
  articulating surfaces of the vertebrae are well-developed and saddle-shaped. The dorsal surface of

  class="pagenum" id="page501"><span class="smaller">{501}</span></span>The order is divided into
  three families, two of which are represented in British waters.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Astroschemidae.</b>&mdash;Arms unbranched. <i>Astronyx</i> is comparatively common
  in the sea-lochs of Scotland. There are a series of pad-like ridges on the arms, representing the
  side-plates and bearing the spines. <i>Astroschema</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Trichasteridae.</b>&mdash;Arms forked only at the distal ends. <i>Trichaster</i>,
  <i>Astrocnida</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Euryalidae.</b>&mdash;Arms forked to their bases. <i>Gorgonocephalus</i> is
  occasionally taken in deep water off the north coast of Scotland. In it the arms repeatedly fork,
  so that a regular crown of interlacing arms is formed. The animal obviously clings to external
  objects with these, for it is often taken in fishermen's nets with its arms coiled around the
  meshes. The genital bursae are said to be represented by slits which open directly into the
  coelom. (Lyman describes the coelom as divided into ten compartments by radiating septa; it is
  possible&mdash;even probable&mdash;that these are really the bursae.) An allied species is common
  in the Bay of Fundy, being found in comparatively shallow water. <i>Astrophyton</i> (Fig. 222) is
  closely allied to <i>Gorgonocephalus</i>, differing only in trifling points. It is doubtful
  whether the separation of these two genera is justified.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Ophiuroidea.</b>&mdash;The Ophiuroidea are rather sparsely represented among fossils,
  but in the Silurian and Devonian a series of very interesting forms occur which are intermediate
  in character between Starfish and Brittle Stars, and which were therefore in all probability
  closely allied to the common ancestors of modern Ophiuroids and Asteroids. Jaekel<a id="NtA_469"
  href="#Nt_469"><sup>[469]</sup></a> has recently added largely to our knowledge of these primitive
  forms, and has described a number of new genera. Thus <i>Eophiura</i> from the Lower Silurian has
  an open ambulacral groove, and the vertebrae are represented by an alternating series of quadrate
  ossicles, each deeply grooved on its under surface for the reception of the tentacle, which was
  not yet (as in modern forms) enclosed in the vertebra. The lateral or adambulacral plates extended
  horizontally outwards, and each bore a series of spines at its outer edge.</p>

  <p>A remarkable fact is that where the halves of the vertebrae (<i>i.e.</i> the ambulacral
  ossicles) diverge in order to form the <span class="pagenum" id="page502"><span
  class="smaller">{502}</span></span>mouth-angles, no less than five or six vertebrae are thus
  affected, instead of only two as in modern forms. The actual "jaw," however, seems, as in modern
  forms, to consist only of the first adambulacral fused to the second ambulacral, so that instead
  of concluding with Jaekel that the "jaws" of modern forms result from the fusion of five or six
  vertebrae, a conclusion which would require that a number of tentacles had disappeared, we may
  suppose that the gaping "angles" of these old forms have, so to speak, healed up, except at their
  innermost portions.</p>

  <p>In <i>Bohemura</i>, which belongs to a somewhat younger stratum, the structure is much the
  same, but the groove in the ambulacral ossicle for the tentacle has become converted into a canal,
  and the ambulacral groove itself has begun to be closed at the tip of the arm by the meeting of
  the adambulacrals.</p>

  <p>In <i>Sympterura</i>, a Devonian form described by Bather,<a id="NtA_470"
  href="#Nt_470"><sup>[470]</sup></a> the two ambulacral plates of each pair have thoroughly
  coalesced to form a vertebra, but there is still an open ventral groove, and no ventral
  plates.</p>

  <p>In the Trias occurs the remarkable form <i>Aspidura</i>, which had short triangular arms, in
  which the tentacle pores were enormous and the ventral plates very small. The radial plates formed
  a continuous ring round the edge of the disc. <i>Geocoma</i> from the Jurassic is a still more
  typical Ophiuroid; it has long whip-like arms, and the dorsal skeleton of the disc is made of
  fifteen plates, ten radials, and five interradials. In the Jurassic the living genus
  <i>Ophioglypha</i>, appears.</p>

  <p>The Cladophiurae are represented already in the Upper Silurian by <i>Eucladia</i>, in which,
  however, the arms branch not dichotomously, as they do in modern forms, but monopodially. There is
  a large single madreporite.</p>

  <p><i>Onychaster</i>, with unbranched arms, which occurs in the Carboniferous, is a representative
  of the Streptophiurae.</p>

  <p class="sp5">It will therefore be seen that the evolution of Ophiuroidea must have begun in the
  Lower Silurian epoch. The Streptophiurae are a few slightly modified survivors of the first
  Ophiuroids. By the time the Devonian period had commenced, the division of the group into
  Zygophiurae and Cladophiurae had been accomplished.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">ECHINODERMATA
  (<i>CONTINUED</i>): ECHINOIDEA = SEA-URCHINS</span></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS III. ECHINOIDEA</p>

  <p>The Sea-urchins or Echinoidea (Gr. <span title="echinos"
  class="fsn">&#x1F10;&chi;&#x1FD6;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, Hedgehog or Sea-urchin), which
  constitute the third class of the Eleutherozoa, have derived both their popular and scientific
  names from the covering of long spines with which they are provided. At first sight but little
  resemblance is to be discerned between them and the Starfish and Brittle Stars. They are devoid of
  any outgrowths that could be called arms; their outline is generally either circular or that of an
  equilateral pentagon, but as their height is almost always smaller than their diameter, they are
  never quite spherical; sometimes it is so small that the animals have the form of flattened
  discs.</p>

  <p>All doubt as to the relationship of the Echinoidea to the Starfish is at once dispelled in the
  mind of any one who sees one of the common species alive. The surface is beset with delicate
  translucent tube-feet, terminated by suckers resembling those of Starfish, although capable of
  much more extension. The animal throws out these organs, which attach themselves by their suckers
  to the substratum and so pull the body along, whilst the spines are used to steady it and prevent
  it from overturning under the unbalanced pull of the tube-feet. When moving quickly the animal
  walks on its spines, the tube-feet being little used. The tube-feet are distributed over five
  bands, which run like meridians from one pole of the animal to the other. These bands are termed
  "radii," and they extend from the mouth, which is situated in the centre of the lower surface, up
  to the neighbourhood of the aboral pole. The radii must be compared to the ambulacral grooves on
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page504"><span class="smaller">{504}</span></span>oral surface of
  the arms of Starfish, and hence in Urchins the aboral surfaces of the arms have, so to speak, been
  absorbed into the disc, so that the oral surfaces have become bent in the form of a semicircle.
  The radii are separated from one another by meridional bands called "interradii," which correspond
  to the interradial angles of the disc of a Starfish and to the sides of its arms. The small area
  enclosed between the upper terminations of the radii is called the "periproct," and this
  corresponds to the entire dorsal surface of the Starfish, including that of the arms.</p>

  <p>One of the commonest species of British Sea-urchin is <i>Echinus esculentus</i>. In sheltered
  inlets, such as the Clyde, it is often left exposed by the receding tide, whilst everywhere on the
  coast in suitable localities it may be obtained by dredging at moderate depths on suitable ground.
  In the Clyde it is easy to observe the habits of the animal through the clear still water. It is
  then seen to frequent chiefly rocky ground, and to exhibit a liking for hiding itself in crevices.
  Often specimens will be seen clinging to the rock by some of their tube-feet, and, as it were,
  pawing the under surface of the water with the others. In the Clyde it feeds chiefly on the brown
  fronds of <i>Laminaria</i>, with which the rocks are covered. In more exposed situations, such as
  Plymouth Sound, it does not occur in shallower water than 18 to 20 fathoms. At this depth it
  occurs on a rocky ridge; but in 1899, after a south-west gale, all the specimens had disappeared
  from this ridge, showing at what a depth wave disturbance is felt.</p>

  <p>A full-grown specimen is as large as a very large orange; its under surface is flattened, and
  it tapers somewhat towards the aboral pole. The outline is that of a pentagon with rounded angles.
  The spines in <i>Echinus esculentus</i> are short in comparison to the diameter of the body, and
  this is one of the characteristics of the species.</p>

  <p>The animal is provided with a well-developed skeleton, consisting of a mail of plates fitting
  closely edge to edge, and carrying the spines. This cuirass bears the name "corona" (Fig. 227). It
  has two openings, an upper and a lower, which are both covered with flexible skin. The upper area
  is known as the "periproct" (Fig. 227, <span class="smaller">2</span>); it has in it small
  isolated plates, and the anus, situated at the end of a <span class="pagenum" id="page505"><span
  class="smaller">{505}</span></span>small papilla, projects from it on one side of the centre. The
  lower area of flexible skin surrounds the mouth, and is called the "peristome" (Fig. 229), though
  it corresponds to considerably more than the peristome of Asteroidea. In the mouth the tips of the
  five white chisel-like teeth can be seen.</p>

  <p>The plates forming the corona are, like all the elements of the skeleton of Echinodermata,
  products of the connective tissue which underlies the ectoderm, which in Echinoidea remains in a
  fully developed condition covering the plates, and does not, as in Ophiuroidea, dry up so as to
  form a mere cuticle. The ectoderm consists of the same elements as that of Asteroidea, viz.
  delicate tapering sense-cells with short sense-hairs, somewhat stouter supporting cells and
  glandular cells. It is everywhere underlaid by a plexus of nerve fibrils, which, in part, are to
  be regarded as the basal outgrowths of the sense-cells and partly as the outgrowths of a number of
  small bipolar ganglion-cells, found intermixed with the fibres.</p>

  <p>Just as the <b>muscular arm</b> has been the determining factor in the structure of the
  Ophiuroidea, so the <b>movable spine</b> has been <span class="pagenum" id="page506"><span
  class="smaller">{506}</span></span>the leading factor in the evolution of Echinoidea. The
  <b>spines</b> have cup-shaped basal ends, which are inserted on special projections of the plates
  of the skeleton called tubercles. The tubercle is much larger than the cup, and hence the spine
  has a great range of possible motion. The spines differ from those of Starfish and Brittle Stars
  in being connected with their tubercles by means of cylindrical sheaths of muscle fibres, by the
  contraction of which they can be moved in any direction. The muscles composing the sheath consist
  of an outer translucent and an inner white layer. The former are easily stimulated and soon relax;
  they cause the movements of the spines. The latter require stronger stimulation, but when aroused
  respond with a prolonged tetanus-like contraction, which causes the spines to stand up stiffly in
  one position; these muscles can be torn across sooner than forced to relax. Uexk&uuml;ll<a id="NtA_471"
  href="#Nt_471"><sup>[471]</sup></a> has appropriately named them "block musculature." These
  sheaths, like everything else, are covered with ectoderm, which is, however, specially nervous, so
  that we may say that the muscular ring is covered by a nerve-ring from which stimuli are given off
  to the muscles.</p>

  <p>The spines are, speaking generally, of two sizes, the larger being known as "primary spines"
  and the smaller as "secondary." In many Echinoidea these two varieties are very sharply
  contrasted, but in <i>Echinus esculentus</i> there is not such a great difference in length, and
  intermediate kinds occur. The forest of spines has an undergrowth of <b>pedicellariae</b>. All
  Echinoidea possess pedicellariae, which are much more highly developed than those of any Asteroid.
  With few exceptions all the pedicellariae of Echinoidea possess three jaws and a basal piece. This
  latter is, however, drawn out so as to form a slender rod, which articulates with a minute boss on
  a plate of the skeleton.</p>

  <p>Of these pedicellariae there are in <i>E. esculentus</i> four varieties, viz. (1) "tridactyle"
  (Fig. 225, C; Fig. 226, B): large conspicuous pedicellariae with three pointed jaws, each armed
  with two rows of teeth on the edges. There is a flexible stalk, the basal rod reaching only half
  way up. These are scattered over the whole surface of the animal.</p>

  <p>(2) "Gemmiform" (Fig. 225, A, B; Fig. 226, A), so called from the translucent, almost globular
  head. The appearance of <span class="pagenum" id="page507"><span
  class="smaller">{507}</span></span>the head is due to the fact that there is on the outer surface
  of each jaw a sac-like gland developed as a pouch of the ectoderm. From it are given off two ducts
  which cross to the inner side of the blades and, uniting into one, run in a groove to near the
  tip. The gland secretes a poisonous fluid. The basal rod reaches up to the jaws, so that this form
  of pedicellaria has a stiff stalk. On the inner side of each blade, near the base, there is a
  slight elevation (Fig. 225, B, <i>s</i>), consisting of cells bearing long cilia; this is a
  sense-organ for perceiving mechanical stimuli. The gemmiform pedicellariae are particularly
  abundant on the upper surface of the animal.</p>

  <p>(3) "Trifoliate" (Fig. 225, E; Fig. 226, D): these are very small pedicellariae, in which the
  jaws are shaped like leaves with the broad end projecting outwards. They are scattered over the
  whole surface of the body.</p>

  <p>(4) "Ophicephalous" (Fig. 225, D; Fig. 226, C): pedicellariae in which the jaws have broad
  rounded distal ends fringed with teeth; these ends bear a resemblance to a snake's head, whence
  the name. The bases are also broad and thin, with a strong median rib and a peculiar semicircular
  hoop beneath the spot where they articulate with one another. The three hoops of the three jaws
  work inside each other in such a way as to cause the jaws to have a strong grip and to be very
  difficult to dislocate from their mutual articulation.</p>

  <p>The ophicephalous pedicellariae are in <i>Echinus</i> the most abundant of all; and they alone
  extend on to the peristome, where a special small variety of them is found.</p>

  <p>A thorough investigation of the functions and reactions of the pedicellariae has quite recently
  been made by von Uexk&uuml;ll.<a id="NtA_472" href="#Nt_472"><sup>[472]</sup></a> He showed, first of
  all, that there is a nervous centre in the stalk of each pedicellaria (see below), which causes
  the organ to incline towards a weak stimulus, but to bend away from a stronger stimulus. In the
  head there is an independent nervous centre, which regulates the opening and closing of the
  valves, and causes these to open on slight stimulus and close when a stronger one is applied. The
  amount of stimulus necessary to cause the pedicellariae to retreat varies with the kind of
  pedicellariae, being least with the tridactyle and most with the gemmiform, so that when a
  chemical stimulus, such as a drop of dilute ammonia, is applied to the skin, the tridactyle
  pedicellariae may be seen to flee from and the gemmiform to approach the point of stimulation. In
  a living Sea-urchin, if the attempt is made to seize the tridactyle pedicellariae they will evade
  the forceps, but the ophiocephalous are easy to catch.</p>

  <p>The tridactyle pedicellariae open with the very slightest mechanical stimulus and close with
  rather greater mechanical stimuli or with exceedingly slight chemical ones. Uexk&uuml;ll calls them
  "Snap-pedicellariae," and their function is to seize and destroy the minute swimming larvae of
  various sessile parasitic <span class="pagenum" id="page509"><span
  class="smaller">{509}</span></span>animals, which would otherwise settle on the delicate exposed
  ectoderm of the Sea-urchin.</p>

  <p>The gemmiform pedicellariae are brought into action when a more serious danger threatens the
  Sea-urchin, such as an attack of a Starfish. The corrosive chemical influence, which it can be
  proved exudes not only from the stomach but even from the tube-feet of the Starfish, causes the
  gemmiform pedicellariae to approach and open widely. When the foe approaches so closely as to
  touch the sense-organs (Fig. 225, B, <i>s</i>) situated on the inner side of the valves of these
  pedicellariae, the blades close violently, wounding the aggressor and causing its juice to exude,
  thus producing a renewed and severe chemical stimulation which irritates the poison glands and
  causes the poison to exude. The virulence of the poison may be gauged from the fact that the bite
  of a single gemmiform pedicellaria caused a frog's heart to stop beating.</p>

  Sea-urchin and a Starfish. When the latter approached, the spines of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page510"><span class="smaller">{510}</span></span>Sea-urchin diverged widely (strong form of
  reaction to chemical stimulus), exposing the gemmiform pedicellariae. These at once seized the
  tube-feet of the enemy and the Starfish retreated, wrenching off the heads of these pedicellariae;
  then the Starfish returned to the attack and the same result followed, and this was repeated till
  all the pedicellariae were wrenched off, when the Starfish enwrapped its helpless victim with its
  stomach.</p>

  <p>The minute trifoliate pedicellariae are brought into play by any prolonged general irritation
  of the skin, such as bright light or a rain of particles of grit or mud. They have the peculiarity
  that not all the blades close at once, so that an object may be held by two blades and smashed by
  the third. They may be seen in action if a shower of powdered chalk is poured on the animal, when
  they seize the particles and by breaking up any incipient lumps reduce the whole to an impalpable
  powder, which the cilia covering the skin speedily remove. In thus assisting in the removal of
  mechanical "dirt" they earn the name which Uexk&uuml;ll has bestowed on them, of "cleaning

  consists of two vertical rows of plates throughout most of its extent, and each plate is studded
  with large bosses, or "primary tubercles" for the primary spines, smaller bosses called "secondary
  tubercles" for the secondary spines, and finally, minute elevations called "miliary tubercles" for

  <p>Even in the dried skeleton, however, the ambulacral plates can be discriminated from the
  interambulacral by the presence of pores to permit the passage of the tube-feet. These pores are
  arranged in pairs, and each pair corresponds to a single tube-foot, since the canal connecting the
  ampulla with the external portion of the tube-foot is double in the Echinoidea. In <i>Echinus
  esculentus</i> there are three pairs of such pores in each plate, in <i>Strongylocentrotus
  dro&euml;bachiensis</i> four pairs. The ambulacral plate is really made up of a series of
  "pore-plates," each carrying a single pair of pores, and these become united in threes in
  <i>Echinus</i> and fours in <i>Strongylocentrotus</i>, while in primitive forms like the Cidaridae
  they remain separate. Each ambulacral and interambulacral area ends at the edge of the periproct
  with a single plate. The plate terminating the ambulacral band is pierced by a single pore for the
  exit of the median tentacle, which, as in Asteroids, terminates the radial water-vascular canal.
  Thus the aboral end of the radius in an Echinoid corresponds to the tip of the arm in an Asteroid.
  The plate is termed "ocular," because the terminal tentacle has a mass of pigmented cells at its
  base; but no eye-cups can be seen, and there is no evidence that this spot is specially sensitive
  to light. Species which show special sensitiveness to light have often a large number of what we
  may perhaps term secondary eyes. The plate terminating the interambulacral <span class="pagenum"
  id="page513"><span class="smaller">{513}</span></span>series is termed the "genital plate,"
  because it is pierced by the duct of one of the five genital organs. One of the genital plates is
  also pierced by the madreporic pores. Some zoologists have separated the ocular and the genital
  plates under the name of "calyx" from the rest of the corona, under a mistaken idea that they are
  homologous with the plates of the body or calyx of a Crinoid.</p>

  <p>The <b>periproct</b> (Fig. 228, <span class="smaller">4</span>) is covered with small plates
  and bears a few pedicellariae. The <b>peristome</b> (Fig. 229) is covered by flexible skin with
  abundant pedicellariae; it terminates in a thick lip surrounding the mouth, from which the tips of
  five white teeth are just seen projecting. There are ten short tube-feet projecting from the
  peristome&mdash;one pair in each radius&mdash;and each tube-foot terminates in an oval disc and is
  capable of little extension, and each has around its base a little plate. The presence of these
  tube-feet shows that in <i>Echinus</i> the <span class="pagenum" id="page514"><span
  class="smaller">{514}</span></span>peristome extends outwards beyond the water-vascular ring,
  whereas in Asteroidea it is contained entirely within the ring. In the primitive Cidaridae (Fig.
  235) the whole peristome down to the lip surrounding the mouth is covered with a series of
  ambulacral and interambulacral plates similar to those forming the corona, though smaller and not
  immovably united, and the series of tube-feet is continued on to it. It is thus evident that the
  peristome is merely part of the corona, which has become movable so as to permit of the extension
  of the teeth. In <i>Echinus</i> the peristome is continued in each interradius into two branched
  outgrowths called gills, the relation of which to the respiratory function will be described
  later. These gills (Fig. 229, <span class="smaller">2</span>) are situated in indentations of the
  edge of the corona called "gill-clefts" (Fig. 230, <i>g</i>).</p>

  <p>The term ambulacral plate, applied to the plate pierced by the pores for the tube-feet, conveys
  a misleading comparison with the ambulacral plate of an Asteroid. In Echinoids the ambulacral
  groove has become converted into a canal called the "epineural canal," and the ambulacral plates
  form the floor, not the roof, of this canal; they may perhaps correspond with the adambulacral
  plates of the Starfish, which one may imagine to have become continually approximated as the
  groove became narrower until they met.</p>

  <p>The internal organs of the Urchin can best be examined by making a horizontal incision about
  one-third the distance from the mouth and pulling the two parts gently asunder. A large amount of
  fluid escapes from the exceedingly spacious coelomic cavity, the alimentary canal being
  comparatively narrow.</p>

  <p>The <b>alimentary canal</b> commences with a short vertical tube which has been shown to be a
  stomodaeum; this is surrounded by the upper ends of the teeth and their supporting ossicles, which
  are collectively termed "Aristotle's lantern." The oesophagus leads into a baggy, flattened tube,
  the stomach, which runs horizontally round the animal, supported by strings of tissue from the
  coelomic wall, so that it hangs down in a series of festoons. Having encircled the animal, it
  bends directly back on itself and immediately opens into the intestine, which is also a flattened
  tube, which runs round the circumference of the animal, but in the opposite direction, the
  festoons of the second circle alternating with those of the first. The intestine opens into a
  short rectum which ascends vertically to open by the anus. The stomach is accompanied by a small
  cylindrical tube called the "siphon" (Fig. 231, <i>siph</i>), which opens into it at both ends;
  this represents merely a gutter which has been completely grooved off from the main intestine; it
  is lined by cilia, and its function is believed to be that of keeping a stream of fresh water
  flowing through the gut, so as to subserve respiration.</p>

  <p><i>Echinus esculentus</i> seems to feed chiefly on the brown fronds of <i>Laminaria</i> and the
  small animals found thereon, which it chews up with its teeth, but it may regale itself on the
  same diet as Brittle Stars, as Allen<a id="NtA_474" href="#Nt_474"><sup>[474]</sup></a> has shown
  to be the case in Plymouth Sound. Dohrn<a id="NtA_475" href="#Nt_475"><sup>[475]</sup></a> has
  described the Neapolitan <i>Sphaerechinus granularis</i> attacking and capturing Crustacea such as
  <i>Squilla</i>.</p>

  <p>The <b>water-vascular system</b> presents several features of great interest. The ring-canal is
  situated at a considerable distance above the nerve-ring, and is separated from it by the whole of
  the jaws and teeth. It has five small interradial pouches on it, which apparently correspond to
  Tiedemann's bodies in an Asteroid. The stone-canal (Fig. 231) opens as <span class="pagenum"
  id="page517"><span class="smaller">{517}</span></span>usual into the ring-canal, and is
  accompanied by the axial sinus and genital stolon. The name "stone-canal" is very unsuitable in
  this order, for there are no calcifications in its walls; it is a simple membranous tube of
  circular section. On reaching the upper wall of the test it expands into an ampulla, into which
  the numerous ciliated pore-canals traversing the madreporite open. The radial canals, starting
  from the ring-canal, pursue a downward course till they come into contact with the radial
  nerve-cords, and they then bend upwards and run along the centre of the ambulacral region, finally
  terminating in the small terminal tentacles. In the just metamorphosed Echinoid these are
  well-developed tube-feet, each with a well-developed sucker, in the centre of which is a conical
  sensory prominence, but as development proceeds they become enclosed in a circular outgrowth of
  the test, so that only the tip projects in the adult.</p>

  <p>The long extensible tube-feet are connected by transverse canals with the radial canal. Instead
  of the pair of valves which in Asteroids prevent the reflux of liquid into the canal, there is a
  perforated diaphragm<a id="NtA_476" href="#Nt_476"><sup>[476]</sup></a> with circular muscles,
  which by contraction close the opening in the diaphragm, while when they are relaxed fluid can
  return from the tube-foot. The ampulla is flattened, and is contracted by muscular fibres called
  "trabeculae" stretching across its cavity. These muscular strands are developed by the cells
  lining the ampulla. The external portion of the tube-foot, as in Asteroids, is provided with
  powerful longitudinal muscles, and there is the same alternate filling and emptying of the ampulla
  as the tube-foot is contracted and expanded. The tube-foot is connected by a double canal with the
  ampulla, the object of which is to assist in respiration. The cells lining it are ciliated, and
  produce a current up one side of the tube-foot and down the other, and the double canal leading to
  the ampulla separates these two currents and prevents them interfering with one another. Thus
  water is continually transported from the ampulla to the tube-foot, through the thin walls of
  which it absorbs oxygen, and it is then carried back to the ampulla, and transfers its oxygen to
  the fluid of the general body-cavity through the walls of the ampulla. The disc of the tube-foot
  is supported by a calcareous plate <span class="pagenum" id="page518"><span
  class="smaller">{518}</span></span>(Fig. 232, <i>oss</i>), a circumstance which enabled Johannes
  M&uuml;ller to recognise the Echinoid larva when the form of the adult was as yet unrecognisable. Below
  the edge of the disc there is a well-marked nerve-ring, from which two bundles of nerve-fibres go
  to the disc itself, in the edge of which there is an abundance of sense-cells.</p>

  <p>The buccal tube-feet (Fig. 229, <span class="smaller">4</span>) are much shorter than the rest,
  and are provided with oval discs which are highly sensory. These feet are not used for seizing,
  but for tasting food; when a piece of food is placed near them they are thrown into the most
  violent agitation.</p>

  <p>The <b>nervous system</b> has the same form as in an Asteroid, viz. that of a ring surrounding
  the mouth and giving off radial nerve-cords (Fig. 232, <i>n.r</i>), one of which accompanies each
  water-vascular canal to the terminal tentacle, where it forms a nervous cushion in which pigmented
  cells are embedded.</p>

  <p>A large band-like nerve is given off from the radial nerve-cord to each tube-foot. This pedal
  nerve, as it is called, contains bipolar neurons, and is really an extension of the nerve-cord
  itself. Beneath the sucker it branches out to form a sensory ring. From the base of the pedal
  nerve, branches are given off <span class="pagenum" id="page519"><span
  class="smaller">{519}</span></span>which run to the ectoderm and enter into connexion with the
  plexus there. Romanes<a id="NtA_477" href="#Nt_477"><sup>[477]</sup></a> scraped away the radial
  cords and found that the spines still converged when a point on the ectoderm was stimulated, but
  that, on the other hand, if definite locomotor movements were to be carried out, the presence of
  these cords was a necessity; hence he concluded that the superficial plexus sufficed for ordinary
  reflexes, but that for purposeful movements the central nervous system was necessary.</p>

  <p>Von Uexk&uuml;ll<a id="NtA_478" href="#Nt_478"><sup>[478]</sup></a> has made an exhaustive study of
  the physiology of the nervous system in the Echinoidea. He points out that all the organs
  controlled by the nervous system, spines, pedicellariae, tube-feet, and (see below) Aristotle's
  lantern, give two opposite reactions in response to the same stimulus according as it is strong or
  weak, bending away from the point of stimulation when it is strong and towards it when it is weak.
  This reversal of reaction can only be due to the action of the neuron in altering the effect of
  the stimulus on the muscles, and this Uexk&uuml;ll regards as its fundamental property. Thus in
  Preyer's<a id="NtA_479" href="#Nt_479"><sup>[479]</sup></a> experiments with Starfish the strong
  form of stimulation is obtained by directly applying the stimulus to the radial cord or to the
  tube-feet, the weak form by stimulating the back, when of course the stimulus has to traverse a
  longer path before affecting the tube-feet, and is consequently weakened. Von Uexk&uuml;ll also
  introduces the conception of "tone" with regard to the nervous system. This term has been used to
  denote the amount of chronic contraction in a muscle, and it is to be distinguished from the
  fleeting contractions which cause movement. The more tone there is in a muscle the less responsive
  it is to stimuli tending to bring about movement. As applied to the nervous system "tone" denotes
  a condition when it is not receptive to small stimuli, but when it is maintaining a condition of
  tone in a muscle by which of course its own tone is measured. Tone in a neuron can therefore be
  measured by the produced tone in the muscle, and the one is to be discriminated from the other
  only by using stimulants, such as caffeine, which have no direct action on muscle. Tone can also
  be measured by the amount of stimulus necessary to irritate the neuron. When <span class="pagenum"
  id="page520"><span class="smaller">{520}</span></span>muscles are stretched the tone is lowered,
  and this loss of tone extends to the neuron controlling the muscle, and <i>vice versa</i>. When
  the spines on being gently stimulated bend towards the point of stimulation, this is due to the
  contraction of the muscles on the side towards the point of stimulus, for if the superficial
  plexus of nerve-fibres be cut through so that the stimulus has to pursue a round-about course the
  spine will bend towards the direction from which the stimulus comes. The bending of the spines
  away from the stronger stimulus is likewise due to the muscles on the side towards the stimulus.
  It is caused by a sudden fall of tone in these muscles, which causes them to yield to the tone of
  the muscles on the opposite side, and this fall of tone is due to a fall of tone in the neurons,
  for it can be produced by chemicals, and the direct action of all chemicals applied to muscle is
  to raise tone.</p>

  <p>In <i>Arbacia</i> this form of reaction cannot be produced; the spines respond to stimuli of
  all degrees of intensity by convergence towards the point of stimulation.</p>

  <p>When a general skin-irritant like dilute acetic acid, or even strong light, is applied to the
  skin of a Sea-urchin the spines bend alternately to all points of the compass, or, in a word,
  rotate. This is due to the fact that the weight of the inclined spine stretches the muscles of one
  side and so renders them more open to the general stimulus; these muscles in consequence,
  contract, and so move the spine to a new position in which other muscles are stretched, and a
  similar result follows. A continuation of this process brings about rotation.</p>

  <p>When a piece of glass rod or other light object is laid on the spines of a Sea-urchin, it
  naturally, by its weight, presses asunder the spines and stretches their muscles on one side, thus
  lowering the tone. If now the skin be stimulated at any point the piece of rod will be rolled by
  the spines towards the point of stimulation. This is caused by the fact that the muscles of the
  spines holding the rod are made more receptive by being stretched, and therefore they contract
  more than do the others in response to the stimulation, and so the rod is rolled onwards on to the
  next spines, which then act in the same manner. This passage of stimulus is entirely independent
  of direct nervous connexion between the bases of the spines, for it will traverse at right angles
  a crack going clean through the shell; it is merely the <span class="pagenum" id="page521"><span
  class="smaller">{521}</span></span>result of the mechanical weight of the object and of the
  juxtaposition of the spines.</p>

  <p>If the stimulation be too violent the first spines affected diverge wildly and strike their
  neighbours with vehemence, so arousing into activity the block musculature of these. This causes
  them to stand rigidly up, and so the path of the stimulus is barred.</p>

  <p>Now the escape movements of the animal under strong stimulation which Romanes<a id="NtA_480"
  href="#Nt_480"><sup>[480]</sup></a> alludes to are just an example of this handing on of
  stimulation from spine to spine, not by nervous connexion but by mechanical touch only; the object
  in this case is the substratum on which the animal lies, which is, so to speak, rolled towards the
  point of stimulation, or putting it otherwise, the animal is rolled away from it. Righting when
  upset is another example of the same phenomenon; the aboral spines are stretched by the weight of
  the animal, and the animal acts as if it were stimulated in the region of the periproct. When a
  Sea-urchin is in its normal position and is stimulated in the periproct (as for instance by a
  strong light), it would, according to this rule, tend to move downwards, which is of course
  impossible; but as the stimulus never affects all sides quite alike the result is that the Urchin
  rotates, turning itself ever away from the point of strongest stimulation. In the case of
  <i>Strongylocentrotus lividus</i> when living on limestone, as on the west coast of Ireland, this
  results in the animal excavating for itself holes in the rock, where it is safe from the action of
  the breakers.<a id="NtA_481" href="#Nt_481"><sup>[481]</sup></a></p>

  <p>But it may be objected that no account is taken in the above description of the action of the
  "central nervous system," <i>i.e.</i> of the ring and the radial cords, and yet Romanes found that
  when they were removed the escape movements could not be carried out. The answer is that the
  central nervous system is a store-house of <i>tone</i>, not, as in higher animals, a controlling
  centre for co-ordinating the movements of the spines. When it is removed at first the escape
  movements can be carried out, but in a day or two all tone in the spine-muscles is lost, and then,
  since the tone of all is equally low, there is no tendency in those that are stretched to be more
  responsive than others, and hence the escape movements cannot be carried out. Sea-urchins kept in
  the tanks <span class="pagenum" id="page522"><span class="smaller">{522}</span></span>of an
  aquarium are apt to lose the tone of their spines owing to the poisoning of the nervous
  system.</p>

  <p>The central nervous system is, however, the system which controls the movements of the
  tube-feet. As we have seen, extensions of the radial nerves run to the tip of each podium.
  Tube-feet are chiefly used in ordinary progression; when this is quickened the spines come into
  play exclusively. The extent to which these two organs of locomotion are used varies from genus to
  genus. Thus <i>Centrostephanus</i> uses its spines a good deal, <i>Echinus</i> and
  <i>Strongylocentrotus</i> very little. The last-named genus sometimes walks on its tube-feet
  entirely without touching the ground with its spines.</p>

  <p>The faculty of vision in its simplest form may be defined as sensitiveness to light and shade.
  Now strong light acts on all Sea-urchins as a general skin irritant. They fly from it towards the
  darkest corner, and then if it continues the spines rotate. A number of little violet spines on
  the aboral pole of <i>Centrostephanus longispinosus</i> are especially sensitive to light, and
  hence are almost constantly in rotation. This is due, according to Uexk&uuml;ll,<a id="NtA_482"
  href="#Nt_482"><sup>[482]</sup></a> to a pigment of a purple colour, which can be extracted by
  means of alcohol and which is decomposed by light, the products of decomposition being supposed to
  irritate the nerves. <i>Centrostephanus</i> when exposed to light becomes darker in colour. This
  is due to the migration outwards of amoebocytes, which carry a pigment which acts as a screen in
  order to prevent the valuable visual purple being too rapidly decomposed. Not all Sea-urchins, in
  fact very few of those living in northern waters, give a reaction to shadow. <i>C.
  longispinosus</i> is one of the few; it reacts to a shadow by converging its spines towards it. A
  much larger number of species inhabiting tropical waters show this reaction. It is entirely
  stopped if the radial nerve-cords be removed, whereas the reaction to strong light continues. The
  reaction to shade is strongest after a long previous exposure to light, hence Uexk&uuml;ll has given
  the following explanation of it. The continued irritation due to light, having spread to all the
  spines, eventually reaches the radial cords and is there stored in the bipolar nerve-cells as
  <i>tone</i>. When the light-stimulus is interrupted some of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page523"><span class="smaller">{523}</span></span>the stored tone spreads upwards to the
  spines, causing the weak form of spine reaction, and the spines converge.</p>

  <p>It will be seen therefore that the so-called central nervous system of <i>Echinus</i> does not
  act in any sense as a brain, as indeed might have been guessed from the absence of any
  differentiation in it. As Uexk&uuml;ll points out, when an animal is covered all over with similar
  organs, such as spines and pedicellariae, capable of acting automatically, a brain is not needed.
  The object of a brain is to direct organs which are in a certain place to a danger which may come
  from any quarter, but in the Sea-urchin any spine is as good as any other spine, and such
  orientation is not needed. "In a dog the animal moves its legs, in a Sea-urchin the legs move the
  animal." What the Sea-urchin does need is a means to prevent its pedicellariae attacking its own
  organs with which they may come into contact. Thus it possesses an "autodermin," a chemical
  contained in the ectoderm which paralyses the muscles of the pedicellariae, as may be seen by
  offering to them a spine of the same animal. If, however, the spine be treated with boiling water,
  and then offered, it is viciously seized, showing that this substance can be dissolved out.</p>

  <p>Just as in the case of the Starfish, when the nerve-ring is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page524"><span class="smaller">{524}</span></span>cut through, the tube-feet in the various
  radii are no longer co-ordinated with one another.</p>

  <p>Besides the tips of the tube-feet the Urchin possesses another kind of sense-organ, the
  <b>sphaeridia</b> (Fig. 233). These are minute glassy spheres of calcareous matter attached by
  connective tissue to equally minute bosses on the plates of the ambulacra, generally near the
  middle line. They are in fact diminutive spines, and like the latter are covered with a thick
  layer of ectoderm, beneath which is a particularly well-developed cushion of nerve-fibrils. Only
  the layer of muscles which connects a normal spine with its boss is wanting. Although definite
  experimental proof is lacking, the whole structure of the sphaeridia shows that they belong to the
  category of "balancing organs." As the animal sways from side to side climbing over uneven ground,
  the heavier head of the sphaeridia will incline more to one side or to another, and thus exercise
  a strain on different parts of the sheath, and in this way the animal learns its position with
  regard to the vertical.</p>

  <p>Intervening between the radial nerve-cord and the radial vessel is a single <b>radial
  perihaemal canal</b> (Fig. 232, <i>perih</i>), representing the two parallel canals found in the
  same position in the Asteroid. The five perihaemal canals lead downwards to a space called the
  <b>lantern-coelom</b>, surrounding the oesophagus.<a id="NtA_483"
  href="#Nt_483"><sup>[483]</sup></a> Since the skeleton of the corona is composed of plates
  immovably connected together, muscles corresponding to the ambulacral muscles of the Asteroids
  would be useless, and so the wall of the perihaemal canal remains thin and the side of it turned
  towards the general coelom develops no muscles, and that turned towards the nerve-cord no
  nerve-cells. Where, however, the radial nerve enters the nerve-ring, and on the ring itself, an
  inner layer of nerve-cells is developed from the lantern-coelom which represents the lower or oral
  portions of the radial perihaemal canals. These cells control the muscles moving the teeth. These
  canals are originally parts of the lantern-coelom, but in the adult they become closed off from
  it.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the outer wall of this space are developed the calcareous rods forming <b>Aristotle's
  lantern</b>. These are first: five teeth (Fig. 234, <span class="smaller">11</span>),
  chisel-shaped ossicles of peculiarly hard and close-set calcareous matter, the upper ends (<span
  class="smaller">1</span>) pushing out projections of the upper wall of the lantern-coelom. These
  projections are the growing points of the <b>teeth</b>, whose lower ends pierce the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page526"><span class="smaller">{526}</span></span>ectoderm and project into
  the lower end of the oesophagus. Each tooth is firmly fixed by a pair of ossicles inclined towards
  one another like the limbs of a V and meeting below. Each ossicle is called an "alveolus," and
  taken together they form a "jaw." Their upper ends are connected by a pair of ossicles called
  "epiphyses" (<span class="smaller">13</span>). These two epiphyses meet in an arch above. The jaws
  and their contained teeth are situated interradially. Intervening between successive alveoli are
  radial pieces called "rotulae," which extend directly inwards towards the oesophagus. Above the
  rotulae are pieces termed "radii" or "compasses" (<span class="smaller">2</span>), which are not
  firmly attached to the other pieces but lie loosely in the flexible roof of the
  lantern-coelom.</p>

  <p>The uses of the various components of this structure can be made out from an inspection of the
  muscles which connect them together.</p>

  <p>Overarching each radial perihaemal canal where it leaves the lantern is a bridge of calcareous
  matter called the "auricula" (Fig. 234, <span class="smaller">8</span>). This arises as two rods
  which meet each other in a pent-house over the canal. It is the only part of the skeleton which
  can be compared to the ambulacral ossicles of the Asteroidea, and like them it serves as the point
  of insertion for important muscles. Thus we find (1) protractor (Fig. 234, <span
  class="smaller">7</span>) muscles which arise from the upper ends of the alveoli and are inserted
  in the auricula; when these contract they tend to push the whole "lantern" outwards so as to
  expose the tips of the teeth. (2) The retractor muscles (Fig. 234, <span class="smaller">6</span>)
  extend from the auriculae to the lower ends of the jaws and restore the lantern when it has been
  extruded to its original position. (3) The comminator muscles connect adjacent jaws with one
  another: these on contraction approximate the pair of jaws into which they are inserted, and it
  will easily be seen that by the successive contraction of the five comminator muscles a rotating
  movement of the teeth would be produced which would cause them to exert an action something like
  that of an auger; by their simultaneous contraction the teeth are brought to a point. (4) The
  internal and external rotula muscles: these are small muscles which connect the outer side of the
  epiphysis with the rotula. There are two facets on the epiphysis, which permit it to rock to and
  fro on the rotula under the action of these muscles. This rocking action must greatly increase the
  cutting power of the <span class="pagenum" id="page527"><span
  class="smaller">{527}</span></span>tooth. These muscles are controlled by the nerve-ring and the
  incipient portions of the radial nerves, which, as we have seen, have an inner layer of
  nerve-cells. If the nerve-ring be gently stimulated on one side the upper end of the lantern bends
  away from the spot, causing the lower end, <i>i.e.</i>, the teeth, to move towards it; but a
  stronger stimulation produces the opposite effect, just as is the case with spines. But besides
  these masticatory muscles there are others which have nothing to do with moving the teeth. These
  muscles are attached to the rods called radii or compasses (Fig. 234, <span
  class="smaller">2</span>),<a id="NtA_484" href="#Nt_484"><sup>[484]</sup></a> which lie in the
  upper wall of the lantern-coelom, and may be termed the compass muscles. There are two
  sets:&mdash;(1) The elevator muscles (Fig. 234, <span class="smaller">3</span>), which connect the
  inner ends of the compasses with one another. When these contract, the radii tend to bend upwards
  at the inner ends and thus raise the roof of the coelom. (2) The depressor muscles (Fig. 234,
  <span class="smaller">4</span>), which run downwards from the forked outer ends of the compasses
  to the auriculae. Uexk&uuml;ll<a id="NtA_485" href="#Nt_485"><sup>[485]</sup></a> has shown that the
  function of these muscles and of the rods to which they are attached is respiratory. These muscles
  are also controlled by the nerve-ring. If this be stimulated by passing a pin-head into the
  oesophagus, the roof of the lantern cavity is raised by the contraction of the elevator muscles.
  This is followed by contraction of the depressor muscles lowering it; the same result may be
  brought about by placing the animal in water with excess of carbonic acid. The ten branched gills
  described on p. <a href="#page514">514</a> are outgrowths of the lantern-coelom. When the roof of
  this cavity is depressed the fluid contents are driven out into the gills, which are thus expanded
  and then absorb oxygen from the surrounding sea water. When, on the other hand, the roof is raised
  the aerated water is sucked back into the lantern cavity, and the oxygen passes easily through the
  thin walls of the lantern into the fluid filling the main coelomic cavity. There are thus two
  independent respiratory mechanisms in the Sea-urchin, the one being the compass muscles, the other
  the cilia lining the interior of the tube-feet.</p>

  <p>The function of <b>excretion</b> is performed, as in Asteroidea, by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page528"><span class="smaller">{528}</span></span>the amoebocytes floating in the general
  coelomic cavity. These in part escape through the thin bases of the gills. In other parts of the
  body they seem not to succeed in reaching the exterior at all, but to degenerate and to form
  masses of pigment; the colour of the animal is largely due to these excrementitious
  substances.</p>

  <p>The <b>reproductive system</b>, as in the two preceding orders, consists of a vertical pillar,
  the "genital stolon," and a circular "genital rachis" giving off interradial branches from which
  the genital organs bud. The genital stolon is developed from the wall of the general coelom near
  the upper end of the axial sinus; it attains a great development and ultimately completely
  surrounds the axial sinus, which then appears like the cavity of a glandular tube, the walls of
  which are constituted by the genital stolon. The compound structure consisting of stolon and axial
  sinus was actually described as a nephridium by the Sarasins<a id="NtA_486"
  href="#Nt_486"><sup>[486]</sup></a> in the case of <i>Asthenosoma</i>. Its true nature, however,
  is shown when the upper end is examined; it is then seen to open into the stone-canal and to be in
  communication with the ampulla, into which the pore-canals open. Lying alongside the upper end of
  the axial sinus is the somewhat elongated "madreporic vesicle," or right hydrocoele, which was
  described by Sarasin as the accessory kidney (<i>Nebenniere</i>), since like the axial sinus it is
  partly enveloped by the genital stolon. Leipoldt,<a id="NtA_487"
  href="#Nt_487"><sup>[487]</sup></a> however, showed clearly that it is a completely closed
  space.</p>

  <p>The genital rachis springs from the upper end of the stolon, and as in Asteroids, it lies in
  the outer wall of a space called the "aboral sinus" (Fig. 234, <span class="smaller">20</span>)
  intervening between it and the test. In adult specimens it seems to degenerate. The genital organs
  are situated at the ends of five interradial branches of the rachis (Fig. 231, <i>gon</i>). Each
  is an immense tree-like structure consisting of branching tubes, which are lined by the sexual
  cells. So enormous do they become in the breeding season that they form an article of food among
  fishermen. The term <i>esculentus</i> is derived from this circumstance. Other species are
  regularly sold for food as <i>Frutta di Mare</i> (Fruit of the Sea) at Naples, and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page529"><span class="smaller">{529}</span></span>as "sea eggs" in the West
  Indian Islands.  One female <i>Echinus esculentus</i> will produce 20,000,000 eggs in a
  season.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The so-called <b>blood system</b> is more distinctly developed in Echinoidea than
  in Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea. There is an oral ring of lymphoid tissue surrounding the oesophagus
  below the water-vascular ring. From this are given off two strands, the so-called "dorsal" (Fig.
  231, <i>b.v</i>), and "ventral" vessels (Fig. 234, <span class="smaller">16</span>), which run
  along the two opposite sides of the stomach or first coil of the alimentary canal. The position of
  these strands suggests that like the lacteals of the human intestine they are channels along which
  the products of digestion exude from the stomach. The dorsal strand is situated on the same side
  as the genital stolon, and from it branches are given off which ramify on the surface of the
  stolon, on account of which this organ, as in Asteroidea, was at one time regarded as a "heart,"
  but the distinction of the stolon from the strands is easily made out. An aboral ring enclosing
  the genital rachis lies embedded in the septum dividing the aboral sinus (Fig. 234, <span
  class="smaller">20</span>) from the general coelom.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Classification of Echinoidea.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">The Echinoidea are sharply divided into three main orders, which differ from each
  other profoundly in their habits and structure. These are: (1) The <span
  class="sc">Endocyclica</span> or Regular Urchins, of which the species just described may be taken
  as the type. (2) The <span class="sc">Clypeastroidea</span> or Cake-urchins, which are of
  extremely flattened form, and in which the periproct is shifted from the apical pole so that it is
  no longer surrounded by the genital plates, while some of the tube-feet of the dorsal surface are
  flattened so as to serve as gills. (3) The <span class="sc">Spatangoidea</span> or Heart-urchins,
  in which the outline is oval: the periproct is shifted, as in the Cake-urchins, and the dorsal
  tube-feet are similarly modified; but the Heart-urchins have totally lost Aristotle's lantern,
  whilst the Cake-urchins have retained it. This strongly-marked cleavage of the group was primarily
  due, as in all such cases, to the adoption of different habits by different members of the same
  group. Were we to term the three orders Rock-urchins, Sand-urchins, and Burrowing-urchins, it
  would not be entirely true, for secondary invasions of the other's territory on <span
  class="pagenum" id="page530"><span class="smaller">{530}</span></span>the part of each order have
  undoubtedly taken place; but still the statement would remain roughly true, and would give a fair
  idea of the differences in habitat which have led to the differentiation of the group.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Endocyclica</b> (<i>Regular
  Urchins</i>).</p>

  <p>The principal variations concern (1) the peristome, (2) the periproct, (3) the corona, (4)
  Aristotle's lantern and its appendages, (5) the spines, (6) the pedicellariae, and lastly, (7) the
  tube-feet. We shall consider these points in order.</p>

  <p><b>Peristome.</b>&mdash;In the vast majority of species this region is covered only with
  flexible skin in which ten small plates are embedded, pierced by pores for the buccal tube-feet;
  besides these there are irregularly arranged thin plates. In the Cidaridae both the ambulacral and
  the interambulacral series of plates are continued on it; these plates differ from those of the
  corona in being movable on one another. In Echinothuriidae only the ambulacral series of plates is
  continued on to the peristome. In the case of both these families there are a considerable number
  of tube-feet within the region of the peristome which may be classed as buccal.</p>

  <p><b>Periproct.</b>&mdash;This area, which represents the whole dorsal surface of Asteroidea, is
  very large in the Cidaridae, where, as in <i>Echinus</i>, it is covered with leathery skin in
  which small plates are embedded. In the Saleniidae it is covered with a single large sur-anal
  plate, in the edge of which the anus is excavated; in the Arbaciidae it is covered with four
  valve-like plates; whilst in the remaining species its condition is similar to that described in
  the case of <i>Echinus esculentus</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Corona.</b>&mdash;In Echinothuriidae all the plates are separated by slips of membranous
  skin, so that the test is flexible. In all other families it is an unyielding cuirass. In the
  Cidaridae the pore-plates remain separate throughout life, and are therefore identical with the
  ambulacral plates. These are small and placed in two vertical rows, and so the ambulacra are
  exceedingly narrow. In Echinothuriidae there is some tendency to adhesion amongst the pore-plates;
  these are of different sizes, and usually one larger and one smaller adhere to one another. In all
  other species regular ambulacral plates are formed at least <span class="pagenum"
  id="page531"><span class="smaller">{531}</span></span>in the lower part of the radii near the
  peristome by the adhesion of the pore-plates in groups of two, three, or more. Sometimes as many
  as nine pore-plates may thus adhere.</p>

  <p>When adhesion takes place between the pore-plates it is of course preceded by crowding, and
  this interferes with their equal development. Some which extend so far horizontally as to meet
  their fellows of the opposite side of the radius are called primary plates; others which are small
  and wedged in between the larger ones are called demi-plates. Systems of classification have been
  built up (chiefly by palaeontologists) in which great stress has been laid on how the primaries
  and secondaries enter into the constitution of the compound plate, but it does not seem to the
  present author as if this were at all a satisfactory basis for classification. All the pore-plates
  are primarily equivalent, and the question as to which are interfered with in their growth so as
  to become secondary is trivial. The so-called Arbacioid type consists of one primary with a
  secondary on each side; the Diadematoid type of three primaries, with occasionally a secondary
  between the aboral and the middle primary; and finally the Triplechinoid type of two primaries,
  with one or more secondaries between them.</p>

  <p><b>Aristotle's Lantern.</b>&mdash;Under this head we may consider the auriculae and gills as
  well as the jaws and teeth. In Cidaridae external gills appear to be absent, but from the lantern
  coelom large radial pouches project upwards into the general coelom cavity. These pouches are
  supposed to be respiratory, and are termed <b>internal gills</b> or <b>Stewart's organs</b>.<a
  id="NtA_488" href="#Nt_488"><sup>[488]</sup></a> They co-exist with external gills in
  Echinothuriidae and in Diadematidae, though in the last family they are present only in a
  vestigial form, two being found in each radius. The auricular arch both in Cidaridae and in
  Arbaciidae is composed of two pillars which do not meet, but in the last-named family they are
  based, as in Echinidae, generally on the ambulacral plates, whereas in Cidaridae they arise from
  the interambulacral plates (the ambulacral plates being here very narrow). The epiphyses are
  absent in Cidaridae and Arbaciidae, and are imperfect in Diadematidae.</p>

  <p><b>Spines.</b>&mdash;These organs are extraordinarily variable, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page532"><span class="smaller">{532}</span></span>usually differ very much in species of the
  same genus. In the vast majority of species there is a limited number of long spines called
  "primaries," amongst the bases of which a large number of much shorter "secondaries" are
  distributed. In Cidaridae the primaries are very long and thick and blunt at the ends, and the
  secondaries form small circles around their bases. The primaries in Cidaridae and the tips of the
  primaries in Arbaciidae and Echinothuriidae are covered with a special investment of extremely
  close, hard, calcareous matter very different from the loosely fenestrated material out of which
  the bodies of the spines of all species are composed. In <i>Colobocentrotus</i> and
  <i>Heterocentrotus</i> the primaries are very thick and triangular in section, whilst the
  secondaries on the aboral surface have expanded outer ends, which form a close-set pavement
  protecting the ectoderm from the shocks of the breakers. In Echinothuriidae the primaries are
  short and so delicate as to be termed silky.</p>

  <p><b>Pedicellariae.</b>&mdash;In Cidaridae only gemmiform and tridactyle pedicellariae are found.
  In the gemmiform the glands lie inside the grooved blades instead of outside as normally, and they
  are covered internally by ingrowths of calcareous matter from the edges. In Echinothuriidae only
  tridactyle and trifoliate are found in most species, but rudimentary gemmiform are found in one
  species and well-developed ophicephalous in another. In some species (<i>Centrostephanus
  longispinosus</i>) there are found gemmiform pedicellariae which have lost the jaws but retained
  the glands. These are termed "globiferae." Mortensen<a id="NtA_489"
  href="#Nt_489"><sup>[489]</sup></a> uses minute details in the structure of the pedicellariae to
  discriminate species and even genera, but in this the present author is not prepared to follow
  him.</p>

  <p><b>Tube-feet.</b>&mdash;The tube-feet belonging to the aboral surface are pointed and devoid of
  a sucker in Diadematidae, Echinothuriidae, Arbaciidae, and Cidaridae;<a id="NtA_490"
  href="#Nt_490"><sup>[490]</sup></a> in the last-named family those belonging to the oral surface
  have suckers, in the centre of which a pointed (sensory) prominence is to be noted.</p>

  <p>The <b>classification</b> of the Endocyclica is by no means in a satisfactory condition, and
  different authorities have arrived at <span class="pagenum" id="page533"><span
  class="smaller">{533}</span></span>widely different results. Agassiz,<a id="NtA_491"
  href="#Nt_491"><sup>[491]</sup></a> for instance, places the genera <i>Echinus</i> (the common
  British form) and <i>Strongylocentrotus</i> (the commonest American form) in different families.
  Bell,<a id="NtA_492" href="#Nt_492"><sup>[492]</sup></a> on the other hand, considers them to be
  closely allied. Bell's system, based as it is on the development of the peristome, seems to the
  present author the most justifiable, for the peristome is undoubtedly a differentiation of the
  corona, which has been brought about by the manner in which the animal breathes and masticates,
  two functions of prime importance. The periproct is also of importance, representing as it does
  the whole aboral surface of the Starfish, and so are to a less extent the arrangements of the
  spines and of the tube-feet. Proceeding in this way, living Endocyclica can be divided into six
  families, which are briefly described below.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Cidaridae.</b>&mdash;Endocyclica with a large peristome and a large periproct. The
  peristome is covered with a regular series of both ambulacral and interambulacral plates, the
  former pierced by tube-feet. No special buccal tube-feet and no external gills. The periproct is
  large, and is covered with irregular plates (Fig. 236, A). The lantern coelom is provided with
  large Stewart's organs.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page534"><span class="smaller">{534}</span></span></div>

  <p>The auriculae are incomplete and consist only of pillars arising from the interambulacral
  plates. The ambulacral pore-plates remain disunited, and the pores are arranged in a single
  vertical series; hence the ambulacra are very narrow. The interambulacral plates each bear one
  large primary spine surrounded by several circles of secondaries. No ophicephalous or trifoliate
  pedicellariae are to be found, and the gland of the gemmiform pedicellaria is placed inside the
  concavity of the blade.</p>

  <p>The Cidaridae are in many respects the most primitive of the six families living. They are
  distributed all over the world, and chiefly inhabit deep water. No two naturalists agree as to how
  they are to be divided into genera. Mortensen,<a id="NtA_493" href="#Nt_493"><sup>[493]</sup></a>
  who takes the structure of the pedicellariae as his principal guide, recognises fourteen genera.
  Others (as for instance Bell) have been inclined to attribute nearly all the living species to one
  polymorphic genus, <i>Cidaris</i>, finding all attempts to divide the genera from one another
  frustrated by the discovery of transitional forms. <i>Goniocidaris</i> (Fig. 237), however,
  distinguished by its comparatively broad poriferous zones, by bare places in the middle line of
  both radii and interradii, and by deep pits on the lines of suture of the plates, is by general
  consent distinct. This genus is confined to the Eastern Pacific, but from British waters three
  species of <i>Cidaris</i> have been recorded, only one of which, <i>C.</i> (<i>Dorocidaris</i>)
  <i>papillata</i>, is at all common. It is found in water from 100 to 500 fathoms in depth <span
  class="pagenum" id="page535"><span class="smaller">{535}</span></span>off the western coast of
  Ireland and Scotland. It also occurs in the Mediterranean, and has been carefully examined and
  described when living by Prouho.<a id="NtA_494" href="#Nt_494"><sup>[494]</sup></a> From his
  description it appears that locomotion is effected almost entirely by spines, and that the
  tube-feet of the lower parts of the radii have each in the centre of the disc a pointed
  sense-organ like those in the centre of the first tube-feet of the just metamorphosed
  <i>Echinus</i>, whilst those of the aboral surface have no suckers.</p>

  tube-feet, but no interambulacral plates. No specially modified buccal tube-feet, but external
  gills are present, and internal gills (Stewart's organs) also occur. The periproct is covered with
  numerous small plates. All the plates of the corona are separated by thin slips of flexible body
  wall. Numerous comparatively short primary spines on both ambulacral and interambulacral plates;
  these spines are covered on the tips with a layer of hard dense material.</p>

  <p>This remarkable family is divided by Mortensen into ten genera, based as usual on the
  pedicellariae, but taking into account also the shape of the tip of hard material on the spines.
  Most authors refer the majority of the species to two genera, <i>Phormosoma</i> and
  <i>Asthenosoma</i> (Fig. 238), recognising also a genus <i>Sperosoma</i> for one or two aberrant
  species. <i>Asthenosoma</i> is distinguished by having wide interspaces of membrane between the
  plates, and by having ten longitudinal folds of the body-wall, two in each radius, in which
  powerful longitudinal muscles are developed projecting inwards in the radii. The organs of Stewart
  are very large. In <i>Phormosoma</i>, on the contrary, the interspaces of membrane are very
  narrow, and the longitudinal folds are thin and membranous and the organs of Stewart are
  vestigial. <i>Asthenosoma hystrix</i> and <i>Phormosoma placenta</i> have both been dredged in
  deep water off the Irish coast. <i>A. urens</i>, in which there are ectodermic poison-sacs at the
  bases of the spines, inhabits the Indian Ocean near Ceylon, and was thoroughly <span
  class="pagenum" id="page537"><span class="smaller">{537}</span></span>described by the Sarasins,<a
  id="NtA_495" href="#Nt_495"><sup>[495]</sup></a> who regarded its structure as a proof that
  Echinoidea were derived from Holothuroidea. Both palaeontology and embryology have, however,
  yielded strong evidence that Echinoidea were derived from Asteroidea, and hence there is ground
  for believing that Holothuroidea are descended from primitive Echinoidea and not <i>vice
  versa</i>. The Echinothuriidae may perhaps be regarded as showing the first steps in the change,
  and though possibly not closely related to the actual ancestors of the Holothuroidea, they at any
  rate show parallel modifications.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Saleniidae.</b>&mdash;Endocyclica with a large peristome and periproct. The
  peristome is covered with thin, scattered, irregular plates. There are five pairs of special
  buccal tube-feet, each supported by a special plate, and there are external gills. The periproct
  is excavated in the side of a large central pentagonal plate. It is covered with fifteen or twenty
  plates.<a id="NtA_496" href="#Nt_496"><sup>[496]</sup></a> The ambulacral plates are separate as

  also, as in Cidaridae, each bear one large primary spine surrounded by a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page538"><span class="smaller">{538}</span></span>circle of secondaries. A few deep-water
  forms belong to this family, the type genus <i>Salenia</i> (Fig. 240) being the best known. None
  occur in the British area. Superficially they resemble the Cidaridae, but in reality they are
  widely separated by the essentially modern character of the peristome.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. 4. Arbaciidae.</b>&mdash;Endocyclica with a peristome on which, as in Saleniidae, there
  are only ten prominent plates perforated by the buccal tube-feet, and besides these thin irregular
  plates; external gills are present, and the auricles consist of incomplete arches springing from
  the ambulacral plates. The periproct is covered by four valve-like plates. The ambulacral
  pore-plates are separate near the periproct, but near the peristome unite on the "Arbacioid"
  pattern (<i>v.</i> p. <a href="#page531">531</a>) to form secondary plates. The interambulacral
  plates each carry several spines. No representatives of this remarkable family are known in
  British waters, but <i>Arbacia</i> is found both on the east coast of North America and in the
  Mediterranean. It is distinguished by its conical test. All the upper tube-feet are devoid of a
  sucker; only those on the oral surface are used for locomotion.</p>

  <p>Uexk&uuml;ll has studied the Mediterranean species, and has shown that the spines converge no matter
  how strong the stimulus may be, and so are incapable of aiding in locomotion; also that the
  ectoderm is devoid of ciliation, and hence the faecal matter which falls on the surface of the
  animal is not, as in other genera, allowed to fall off by the divergence of the spines nor swept
  off by the action of the cilia. In its natural habitat the wash of the ripples on the shore
  cleanses the animal. In captivity it is liable to suffocate itself.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 5. Diadematidae.</b>&mdash;Endocyclica with a peristome similar to that of the
  Arbaciidae and the Saleniidae. External gills present and ten buccal tube-feet. Periproct small,
  covered with numerous small plates. The auricles form complete arches arising from the ambulacral
  region. Aristotle's lantern is provided with rudimentary Stewart's organs. The ambulacral
  pore-plates are separated at the apex, but unite orally in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page539"><span class="smaller">{539}</span></span>"Diadematoid" fashion (p. <a
  href="#page531">531</a>) to form compound plates. The interambulacral plates bear numerous
  primaries. The aboral tube-feet are pointed, having lost their suckers.</p>

  <p>This family is represented (according to Agassiz) at the present day by seven genera, none of
  which are found in British waters, though one (<i>Centrostephanus</i>) enters the Mediterranean.
  <i>C. longispinus</i><a id="NtA_497" href="#Nt_497"><sup>[497]</sup></a> was investigated by
  Uexk&uuml;ll and found to be distinguished by its sensitiveness to light and shade, and by the
  quickness of its movements, which were mainly carried out by its long spines. The family resembles
  the Arbaciidae in the pointed aboral tube-feet, but in the complete auriculae it resembles the
  next family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Echinidae.</b>&mdash;Endocyclica with peristome and periproct as in the preceding
  family. External gills and buccal tube-feet present, but Stewart's organs totally absent.
  Ambulacral plates combined on the "Triplechinoid" plan (p. <a href="#page531">531</a>) to form
  secondary plates. Interambulacral plates with numerous tubercles. All the tube-feet have
  suckers.</p>

  <p>This family contains by far the larger number of living genera. It is divided into two
  sub-families, viz.<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) <span class="sc">Temnopleurinae.</span>&mdash;Echinidae in which the plates of the
  corona dovetail into each other by means of pits and knobs along the line of suture. This
  sub-family does not occur in British waters; almost all the species are confined to the Indian and
  Pacific Oceans, but on the east coast of America it is represented by several genera, which
  however inhabit deep water, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Trigonocidaris arbacina</i>.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) <span class="sc">Echininae.</span>&mdash;Echinidae in which the plates meet each
  other in straight, simple sutures.</p>

  <p>This sub-family is represented in British waters by three genera, viz. <i>Echinus</i>,
  <i>Sphaerechinus</i>, and <i>Strongylocentrotus</i>. <i>Echinus</i> is distinguished by having its
  pores arranged in arcs of three, owing to the fact that its pore-plates are united in threes to
  form secondary plates, whilst in the other two genera the ambulacral plates are composed of four
  or more pore-plates. Six species of <i>Echinus</i> have been recorded from British waters, viz.
  <i>E. esculentus</i>, <i>E. acutus</i>, <i>E. miliaris</i>, <i>E. norvegicus</i>, <i>E.
  microstoma</i>, and <i>E. elegans</i>. The validity of the last three is very doubtful. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page540"><span class="smaller">{540}</span></span>Mortensen<a id="NtA_498"
  href="#Nt_498"><sup>[498]</sup></a> regards <i>E. norvegicus</i> and <i>E. microstoma</i> as mere
  variations of <i>E. acutus</i>, and this is probably correct. <i>E. esculentus</i> has already
  been described; its most marked character is the forest of comparatively short, close-packed,
  reddish or white primary spines with which it is covered, between the bases of which the delicate
  secondaries are hard to detect. It is essentially a shallow-water species. <i>E. acutus</i> is
  distinguished by having much fewer and longer primaries and numerous delicate secondaries. It is
  an inhabitant of deeper water, being abundant at 100 fathoms, though stragglers are found in
  shallower water. At the depths at which it lives wave-disturbance can scarcely be felt, and hence
  the long primaries are not irritated.</p>

  <p><i>E. elegans</i> has spines intermediate in character between those of <i>E. esculentus</i>
  and those of <i>E. acutus</i>. Like the latter it is an inhabitant of the deeper water. It seems
  to the present author not at all improbable that further research might show that <i>E.
  acutus</i>, <i>E. elegans</i>, and <i>E. esculentus</i> are all members of continuous series of
  forms; certainly the larvae and early development of <i>E. acutus</i> and <i>E. esculentus</i>,
  the extreme members of the series, are strikingly similar.</p>

  <p><i>E. miliaris</i> differs somewhat widely from the other species and is closely allied to
  <i>E. microtuberculatus</i> of the Mediterranean, from which it is distinguished mainly by the
  greater thickness of the scattered plates on the peristome of the latter species. From the other
  British species it differs in its much smaller size and in the greenish hue of its primary spines,
  which are short and thick and possess purple tips. Its larva is markedly distinct from the larva
  of <i>E. esculentus</i>. <i>E. miliaris</i> is a littoral species, and is found in great numbers
  in some of the Scottish sea-lochs; when the tide recedes, under every stone of the gravelly beach
  several specimens will be found. It has a curious habit of "dressing" itself, <i>i.e.</i> of
  covering itself with fragments of dead shell, sea-weed, etc., which are held in position by the
  aboral tube-feet. This habit aids in concealing the animal, and has probably been developed on
  account of the dangers to which <i>E. miliaris</i> is exposed owing to its littoral habit of
  life.</p>

  <p><i>Sphaerechinus</i> differs from <i>Echinus</i> in the structure of the ambulacral plates, in
  which it agrees with <i>Strongylocentrotus</i>, but it is distinguished from this genus by the
  very deep <span class="pagenum" id="page541"><span class="smaller">{541}</span></span>gill-clefts,
  or indentations of the edge of the corona from which the gills are extruded. Its most marked
  peculiarity, however, as shown by both Mortensen and Uexk&uuml;ll, consists in the highly developed
  character of its gemmiform pedicellariae, on the stalks of which are situated glands. When the
  head with its poison-glands is torn off, the secretion of these stalk-glands can envelop an enemy
  with a glutinous secretion, which impedes its movements. The blades on a slight mechanical
  stimulus divaricate very widely and become locked in this position, so that the enemy's body gets
  in well within their reach. The muscles of the poison-glands contract, but their ducts are bent by
  the act of opening, so that the secretion cannot escape. The sense-organs have stiff hairs, which
  penetrate the surface of the enemy and cause its juices to exude and so stimulate the blades to
  close, and at the same time permit the poison to be expelled. It will be remembered that the
  gemmiform pedicellariae of <i>Echinus</i> open in response to a chemical stimulus and close on a
  mechanical one being superadded; so that their responses are the direct opposite of what occurs in
  <i>Sphaerechinus</i>. <i>S. granularis</i>, a Mediterranean species with short red spines, just
  reaches the Channel Islands.</p>

  <p><i>Strongylocentrotus</i> has shallow gill-clefts and gemmiform pedicellariae, like those of
  <i>Echinus</i>, except that they have a muscular stalk. In the British area it is represented by
  two species, <i>S. lividus</i>, in which the primary spines are markedly longer than the
  secondaries and are of a brownish purple colour, and <i>S. dro&euml;bachiensis</i>, in which the
  primaries are little longer than the secondaries and are of a greenish brown colour. <i>S.
  lividus</i> occurs abundantly in the Mediterranean, and reaches the English Channel and the west
  coast of Ireland. In the last-named locality, where it is exposed to the full sweep of the
  Atlantic, it is said to excavate holes for itself in the limestone rocks, about ten inches in
  depth.<a id="NtA_499" href="#Nt_499"><sup>[499]</sup></a> <i>S. dro&euml;bachiensis</i>, which has been
  recorded in the British area, chiefly from the west coast of Scotland, is one of the most abundant
  members of the fauna of the east coast of America. In the Gulf of St. Lawrence and in the branches
  of the Bay of Fundy it is found in thousands, and <span class="pagenum" id="page542"><span
  class="smaller">{542}</span></span>is frequently left bare at low tide. It thus takes the place of
  <i>E. miliaris</i> in the British fauna. An allied if not identical species, <i>S. purpuratus</i>,
  is found in Puget Sound on the Pacific coast.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Other interesting genera of the Echininae are <i>Echinometra</i>,
  <i>Colobocentrotus</i>, and <i>Heterocentrotus</i>. All possess large, thick primaries, and all
  are elliptical in outline. In <i>Echinometra</i> the primaries are pointed, and the long axis of
  the body makes an oblique angle with the axis passing through mouth and madreporite. In
  <i>Colobocentrotus</i> and <i>Heterocentrotus</i> the axis passing through mouth and madreporite
  is the short axis of the ellipse, and the primary spines are very thick and triangular in section,
  whilst the expanded ends of the secondaries form a closely set armour between the bases of these.
  In <i>Colobocentrotus</i> the test is markedly flattened on the under side, and this flattened
  area is fringed with a circle of primaries; but in <i>Heterocentrotus</i> there are a few rows of
  primaries all over the test. These are tropical genera and are found on the outer side of coral
  reefs, and they require the cuirass of expanded secondaries to protect them against the waves.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Clypeastroidea</b>
  (<i>Cake-urchins</i>).</p>

  <p>The "Cake-urchins" have only one representative in the British area, and this is unsuitable for
  dissection on account of its small size. We shall therefore select as type the "Sand-dollar"
  <i>Echinarachnius parma</i> (Figs. 241, 242), which occurs abundantly in shallow water on the east
  coast of North America. As its popular name implies, this is an extremely flattened Sea-urchin of
  nearly circular outline, so as to suggest a resemblance to the silver dollar of North American
  currency. The peristome is exceedingly small, and is placed in the centre of the lower surface
  (Fig. 241), whilst the periproct is placed on one edge. The outline is not quite circular, for the
  periproct lies in a slight indentation of the edge; and this side is broader and of a lesser
  degree of curvature than the opposite one, so that a secondary bilateral symmetry is superimposed
  on the fundamental radial symmetry common to all Echinoderms. A line drawn so as to pass through
  the anus and the centre of the disc will divide the animal into two similar halves; the periproct
  of course lies in <span class="pagenum" id="page543"><span class="smaller">{543}</span></span>an
  interradius and the axis of symmetry passes through the centre of one radius. We can thus
  distinguish an anterior group of three radii, or "trivium," from a posterior pair or "bivium." The
  madreporite lies in the left anterior interradius. The five genitals and five oculars surround a
  dorso-central plate, which covers the spot which in Endocyclica is occupied by the periproct.</p>

  <p>The whole test is covered with extremely short delicate spines, which form a velvety felt-work,
  and are all of approximately the same length; they are of a brownish purple colour. The spines on
  the dorsal surface are all ciliated, and these cilia cause a current of fresh sea-water to flow
  continually over the modified tube-feet. Pedicellariae are scattered amongst the bases of the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page544"><span class="smaller">{544}</span></span>spines; they are of
  the tridactyle, the gemmiform, and the ophicephalous types, but they have only two jaws.</p>

    </div>

  <p>The ambulacral areas on the upper surface of the test can be distinguished only by the
  flattened respiratory tube-feet (Fig. 242, <i>pod'</i>), which can be seen protruding from between
  the spines. Below these areas are clearly marked, for in the centre of each is a well-marked
  groove proceeding inwards to the peristome. This groove receives lateral branches on its course
  which traverse the adjacent interambulacral regions. The purpose of these grooves will be
  explained later. The interambulacral regions do not reach the peristome, which is entirely
  surrounded by the ambulacral areas. The ambulacral and interambulacral areas both consist of
  somewhat large hexagonal plates, except in the region of the respiratory tube-feet. Here the
  pore-plates are not united with one another. This region in each radius is termed <span
  class="pagenum" id="page545"><span class="smaller">{545}</span></span>a "petal" (Fig. 243, A,
  <i>p</i>), for the respiratory tube-feet are arranged in two rows which diverge from their
  commencement at the "calyx" and slightly converge again towards the outer margin of the disc, and
  thus in a dried specimen the two rows of double pores outline an area having some resemblance in
  shape to the petal of a flower. Besides these double pores for the larger tube-feet there are
  numerous small single pores for the smaller tube-feet; these are found in all the plates,
  ambulacral and interambulacral, of the dorsal surface, but in the neighbourhood of the grooves
  only on the ventral side.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The sphaeridia are only present to the number of one in each radius. Each sphaeridium is
  enclosed in a pit situated near the edge of the peristome.</p>

  <p>A remarkable feature in the skeleton of <i>Echinarachnius</i> which is characteristic in
  greater or lesser degree of all Clypeastroidea is the presence of vertical partitions of
  calcareous matter traversing the coelom and stretching from the upper to the lower surface of the
  test. These are found principally in the peripheral region of the animal; and there can be no
  doubt that they have originated as cellular bands traversing the coelom, for the formation of
  similar structures can be followed step by step in the Crinoidea. In the axis of these trabeculae,
  or folds of the coelomic wall, jelly is secreted, and into this the lime-producing <span
  class="pagenum" id="page546"><span class="smaller">{546}</span></span>amoebocytes wander. In
  <i>Echinarachnius</i> these partitions are arranged in groups, each group radiating from a common
  centre.</p>

  <p>The main peculiarities in the structure of <i>Echinarachnius</i> are comprehensible when the
  species is viewed from above in its normal environment. It is found in comparatively shallow water
  on a sandy bottom, and normally is nearly but not quite buried in the sand. It might thus be
  overturned by the force of the waves and currents, and it is protected against this fate by its
  flattened shape. This shape, however, necessitates some kind of support for the upper part of the
  test, and this is provided by the internal partitions.</p>

  <p>In order to view the internal anatomy of the "Sand-dollar," it is necessary carefully to pick
  away the dorsal surface of the shell piece by piece. In this way the whole course of the
  alimentary canal is exposed; as in <i>Echinus esculentus</i> it can be seen to issue from the
  upper surface of Aristotle's lantern. It then bends sharply to the left, and makes a complete
  circle round the edge of the disc; this portion is the stomach, and is considerably inflated and
  accompanied by a "siphon." It then bends sharply back on itself, but only goes half way round;
  when it reaches the posterior interradius it ends in the anus (Fig. 244).</p>

  <p>Aristotle's lantern is greatly simplified as compared with its condition in the Regular
  Urchins. Both rotulae and compasses are absent; the jaws are sharply bent on themselves, and their
  appearance gives one the impression that they have shared in the process of compression which the
  test as a whole has undergone, and have thus become bent. The teeth are nearly horizontal, and
  they actually articulate with the auriculae, which, as in Cidaridae, consist of disconnected
  pillars and spring from the plates of the interradius. Each pillar is fused with the adjacent one
  belonging to the next radius, so that the system which in <i>Echinus</i> consists of five radial
  arches here consists of five interradial pillars. Aristotle's lantern has lost its respiratory
  function and apparently its masticatory function as well, for the teeth are used as spades to
  shovel into the mouth the sand mixed with organic detritus and small organisms on which the animal
  lives.</p>

  <p>The water-vascular system is highly modified. There are two sharply marked kinds of
  tube-feet&mdash;(<i>a</i>) the respiratory tube-feet, (<i>b</i>) the locomotor tube-feet. Both
  kinds are terminated by <span class="pagenum" id="page547"><span
  class="smaller">{547}</span></span>suckers, but the first variety are much larger than the second;
  they possess a flattened lobed base, and are connected with the ampulla by a double canal. They
  issue only from the double pores which form the petal. The locomotor tube-feet are small and
  cylindrical; they are, as already mentioned, scattered over the whole upper surface of the test,
  penetrating both ambulacral and interambulacral plates, but all are connected by transverse canals
  with the radial canals of the water-vascular system. On the under surface they are confined to the
  neighbourhood of the ambulacral grooves, which have nothing to do with the ambulacral grooves of
  an Asteroid, but are due to secondary localisations of the tube-feet, which are here also
  connected in each radius with a single radial canal. The appearance of a living
  <i>Echinarachnius</i> covered with a veritable forest of short brown tube-feet is very striking.<a

  <p>The condition of the water-vascular system is to be explained entirely by the peculiar
  environment of the animal. The demand for specialised respiratory organs is brought about by the
  habit of living half buried in the sand. Under these circumstances the strain of supplying the
  needful oxygen is thrown on the <span class="pagenum" id="page548"><span
  class="smaller">{548}</span></span>dorsal tube-feet, and they become modified in order to fit them
  for this function. The locomotor tube-feet are very small and feeble compared with those of
  <i>Echinus esculentus</i>, but this is comprehensible when it is recollected how little resistance
  the yielding sand would offer to the pull of a powerful tube-foot like that of the Regular
  Urchins, for in order to move the creature through the sand a multitude of feeble pulls
  distributed all over its surface is necessary, and the locomotor tube-feet are exactly fitted,
  both as to size and number, for this object.</p>

  <p>The principal points in which Clypeastroidea vary amongst themselves are (1) the nature of the
  internal skeleton, (2) the shape, and (3) the spines.</p>

  <p><b>Internal Skeleton.</b>&mdash;In <i>Echinocyamus</i> and its allies this consists in each
  interradius of two simple partitions radiating out towards the edge of the disc; in <i>Laganum</i>
  it consists of walls parallel to the edge of the disc; in <i>Clypeaster</i>, of isolated
  pillars.</p>

  <p><b>Shape.</b>&mdash;In <i>Echinocyamus</i> the outline is oval and the test comparatively high.
  In <i>Clypeaster</i> and its allies the outline is pentagonal, and the test is swollen up into a
  blunt elevation in the centre. In a large number of genera, however, the test is, as in
  <i>Echinarachnius</i>, extremely thin and flat, and the outline may be variously indented. A first
  indication of this process is seen in <i>Echinarachnius</i> itself, but in <i>Rotula</i> the edge
  is drawn out into finger-like processes which are all interradial. In <i>Mellita</i> these
  processes unite with one another distally so as to surround spaces called "lunules," which appear
  as perforations of the test.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <b>Classification</b> of the Clypeastroidea adopted by Agassiz is based chiefly
  on the degree of development of the internal skeleton, and as this is of great physiological
  importance to the animals we shall follow it here; but since it was published the remarkable
  discovery has been made of <i>Pygastrides</i>, a type previously known only from fossils. We must
  therefore recognise two sub-orders<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order I. Protoclypeastroidea.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">Anus on dorsal surface near apical pole. One species, <i>Pygastrides
  relictus</i>,<a id="NtA_501" href="#Nt_501"><sup>[501]</sup></a> with no "petals," from deep water
  in the Caribbean Sea.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page549"><span class="smaller">{549}</span></span></div>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Sub-Order II. Euclypeastroidea.</b></p>

  <p>Anus on under surface.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Fibularidae.</b>&mdash;The "petals" are short and imperfect, and the internal
  skeleton consists of two short outwardly-directed septa in each interradius. To this family the
  only British Clypeastroid, <i>Echinocyamus pusillus</i>, belongs. This animal never exceeds an
  inch in length, and has an oval outline. It inhabits shallow water, and is often found in the same
  ground as <i>Echinus miliaris</i>, but like all Clypeastroids it prefers a sandy bottom.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Echinanthidae</b> or <b>Clypeastridae</b>.&mdash;"Petals" well marked, internal
  skeleton consisting of isolated pillars. The largest Cake-urchins belong to this family, which is
  found chiefly in tropical waters. <i>Clypeaster</i>, the great Cake-urchin, with a deeply sunken
  peristome, belongs to this family.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Laganidae.</b>&mdash;Closely allied to the foregoing, but distinguished by the fact
  that the internal skeleton consists of walls parallel to the edge of the test. (<i>Laganum</i>,
  <i>Arachnoides</i>, <i>Peronella</i>.)</p>

  <p class="sp3"><b>Fam. 4. Scutellidae.</b>&mdash;This family includes about half the genera, and
  is sharply distinguished from all the rest by (1) the extremely flattened shape, (2) the
  indentation of the outline in the anal interradius and often elsewhere, (3) the branching of
  ambulacral furrows on the under surface. <i>Echinarachnius</i>, taken as the type in describing
  the anatomy of the Cake-urchins, is the best-known genus. Others are <i>Mellita</i>, with five
  perforations in the edge of the test; and <i>Rotula</i>, with the edge produced into a number of
  finger-like processes.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order III. Spatangoidea</b>
  (<i>Heart-urchins</i>).</p>

  <p>As the type we may select <i>Echinocardium cordatum</i>, which occurs abundantly in the Clyde
  and on the west coast of Ireland. The animal is found buried in sand at a depth of about 8-10
  inches from the surface. At this depth it lies in a burrow, the walls of which are kept from
  collapsing by the somewhat broadened tips to the spines. This burrow communicates with the surface
  by a narrow cylindrical opening similar to the opening of the burrows made by the Clams and other
  bivalves. A little practice, however, enables one to distinguish the burrow of the Heart-urchin
  from these.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page550"><span class="smaller">{550}</span></span></div>

  <p>The animal is about the size of a small potato, and is of light straw colour. Its outline is
  oval, and the test is about two-thirds as high as the shorter diameter. It is thus higher in
  proportion to its width than is the case with any living Cake-urchin. The highest point is behind
  the centre. The narrower end of the animal terminates in a vertical edge, in the upper part of
  which is a large periproct covered with a number of thin movable plates. The mouth is situated on
  the under surface, considerably nearer the front end of the test than the hinder end. It is
  entirely devoid of jaws or of teeth, and also of gills or of a movable peristome.</p>

  <p>Aristotle's lantern has entirely disappeared, leaving as the only trace of its former presence
  a canal with membranous walls encircling the mouth, which has the form of a transverse slit, the
  posterior lip projecting considerably forward.</p>

  <p>The ambulacral areas are easily distinguishable from the interambulacral areas by being
  comparatively bare of spines. On the upper surface they are distinctly grooved, the groove being
  especially deep in the case of the anterior one. On the lower surface they coalesce round the
  mouth, shutting out the interambulacral regions, and are here perforated by the large pores of the
  buccal tube-feet. Between the two posterior radii on the oral surface there is a space with
  specially arranged spines called the plastron or sternum. The interambulacral plates composing
  this region are very much lengthened, and interdigitate with one another at the sutures. To this
  lengthening is due the apparent forward shift of the mouth. The spines are very characteristic,
  and are very different from any which have as yet been described. They are the sole organs of
  locomotion. The primaries are long and curved, with flattened tips, admirably adapted to plough
  through the sand in which the animal lives. On the upper surface, mingled with the tube-feet, are
  a large number of small secondary spines. Between the two posterior petals there is a hoop-shaped
  band of very small black spines. These spines are ciliated, and draw a current of fresh sea-water
  over the respiratory tube-feet. Beneath the periproct there is a similar band called the "sub-anal
  fasciole"; this probably produces a current of water which sweeps away the material ejected from
  the anus.</p>

  <p>The pedicellariae are of the trifoliate and gemmiform varieties. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page551"><span class="smaller">{551}</span></span>The sphaeridia are situated in open pits,
  one or two in each, situated at the bases of the tube-feet nearest the mouth.</p>

  <p>When the upper part of the test is picked away, the course of the alimentary canal is exposed
  (Fig. 247). It is very similar to the alimentary canal of <i>Echinarachnius</i>, except that from
  the first coil a large blind pouch, called the caecum, is given off.</p>

  <p>The water-vascular system shows many characteristic features. The tube-feet are confined to two
  rows in each ambulacrum, the scattered smaller feet found in such abundance in
  <i>Echinarachnius</i> being entirely absent. There are four distinct varieties of tube-feet in
  <i>Echinocardium</i>, which are as follows:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) The respiratory tube-feet of the
  petals. These have, as in <i>Echinarachnius</i>, broad flat bases, but they have lost the sucker.
  (<i>b</i>) The prehensile tube-feet of the anterior ambulacrum. These are enormously long
  structures, measuring when expanded several times the length of the body. They end in discs, which
  are frayed out into fingers, so as to look like miniature sea-anemones. These tube-feet are
  comparatively few in number and are confined to the apical portion of the anterior ambulacrum.
  (<i>c</i>) The buccal tube-feet. These are short, thick, and pointed, and covered with a multitude
  of club-shaped processes. They are found on all the ambulacra in the neighbourhood of the mouth.
  (<i>d</i>) The degenerate tube-feet found in the portions of the ambulacra between the "floscelle"
  (see p. <a href="#page553">553</a>) and the petals. These are single and pointed, few in number,
  and issue from single pores in the test.</p>

  <p>This extraordinary diversity in the tube-feet is fully explained <span class="pagenum"
  id="page552"><span class="smaller">{552}</span></span>when the habits of the animal are known. The
  function of the respiratory tube-feet requires, of course, no special elucidation, but the
  peculiar anterior ambulacrum was a mystery till the feeding habits of the animal were observed by
  the late Dr. Robertson<a id="NtA_502" href="#Nt_502"><sup>[502]</sup></a> of Cumbrae. He found
  that the animal protruded the long prehensile tube-feet through the opening of the burrow up to
  the surface of the sand. With their finger-like processes they then collected the surface film of
  the sand, which was impregnated with Diatoms and other small organisms. When a "handful," so to
  speak, of this nutritive material has been collected, the long tube-foot is withdrawn down the
  burrow and passed over the deeply grooved part of the ambulacrum to the buccal tube-feet, to which
  the food is given up. These last then push it into the mouth. Only one prehensile tube-foot is
  extended at a time.</p>

  <p>The stone-canal is very short and soon opens into the axial sinus; it is widely separated from
  the pore-canals which traverse the madreporite. Communication between the two is effected by the
  long axial sinus. There are only four genital organs.</p>

  <p>Heart-urchins vary amongst themselves chiefly in the <span class="pagenum" id="page553"><span
  class="smaller">{553}</span></span>following points, viz.:&mdash;(1) the shape and position of the
  peristome, (2) the characters of the "petals," and (3) the number and position of the
  fascioles.</p>

  <p><b>Peristome.</b>&mdash;In many genera this is pentagonal and central, and in these cases the
  interradii commence at the peristome with a single plate, which is often covered with a thick
  crowd of small spines and is termed a "bourrelet." The oral ends of the radii also often consist
  of a crowded series of narrow plates, looking something like a "petal," and termed a "phyllode."
  The five bourrelets and five phyllodes constitute a flower-like figure termed a "floscelle."</p>

  <p><b>Ambulacra.</b>&mdash;In <i>Echinoneus</i> all five are alike and are provided with similar
  tube-feet, which are respiratory but possess suckers. The ambulacra are not grooved, and the
  petaloid arrangement of the pores is hardly marked; but in <i>Cassidulus</i>, <i>Pourtalesia</i>,
  and many other genera the five petals are well marked, though they are all similar to one
  another.</p>

  <p><b>Fascioles.</b>&mdash;These structures are often entirely absent; the sub-anal one alone is
  present in <i>Spatangus</i>. In <i>Eupatagus</i> a peripetalous one is added. This surrounds all
  the "petals," and has obviously the function of sweeping fresh water over the respiratory
  tube-feet. In <i>Echinocardium</i>, as we have seen, there is an "internal fasciole" between the
  two anterior petals which has a similar function. In addition, this genus possesses an anal
  fasciole which surrounds the anus and sweeps away the faeces.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The <b>Classification</b> of the <i>Spatangoidea</i> is based mainly on the degree of
  development of the petals, that is to say, on the extent to which the burrowing habit has been
  developed. But weight is also laid on the shape of the peristome, the pentagonal form being more
  primitive. Seven families are recognised, which are as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><b>Fam. 1. Echinonidae.</b>&mdash;"Petals" hardly marked at all; peristome in the centre of the
  lower surface and pentagonal. Floscelle not developed.</p>

  <p>One genus, <i>Echinoneus</i> (Fig. 248).</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page554"><span class="smaller">{554}</span></span></div>

  <p><b>Fam. 2. Nucleolidae.</b>&mdash;"Petals" distinct; peristome as in the foregoing family. No
  floscelle. <i>Nucleolites</i>, with the anus in a furrow. <i>Anochanus</i>, with a concave apical
  system serving as brood-pouch.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 3. Cassidulidae.</b>&mdash;"Petals" usually distinct; peristome eccentric, but provided
  with a well-marked floscelle.</p>

  <p><i>Echinolampas</i>, with the anus on the under surface.</p>

  <p><i>Neolampas</i>, with the anus on a projecting papilla. One specimen of this genus has been
  dredged in the British area.</p>

  <p>The three foregoing families probably use their tube-feet to walk with, and bury themselves
  only to a slight extent. They are often united as a sub-order, the <span
  class="sc">Asternata</span>, and distinguished from all the rest which possess an eccentric mouth
  and well-marked plastron. These families are then grouped together as <span
  class="sc">Sternata</span>. They are as follows<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Fam. 6. Spatangidae.</b>&mdash;Spatangoidea of more or less flattened shape, with
  well-marked petals and a sub-anal plastron as well as the ventral one. One fascicle at least, but
  a peripetalous one never present. The anterior ambulacrum grooved and different from the rest.
  This family is represented in British waters by two genera, <i>Spatangus</i> and
  <i>Echinocardium</i>. The former possesses only a sub-anal fasciole, and has specially long curved
  spines on the ventral plastron. It is represented by two species, <i>S. purpureus</i> and <i>S.
  raschi</i>, the latter being distinguished by a pointed lower lip. It is a deep-water species,
  found in 100 fathoms and over on the west coast. <i>S. purpureus</i> is fairly common in rather
  shallow water. From observations made on specimens kept in confinement it appears to burrow only
  so far as to leave the petals uncovered; hence there is no need of a peripetalous fasciole.
  <i>Echinocardium</i> is devoid of the thicker spines on the plastron, and has an internal fasciole
  and a perianal one as well as the sub-anal. As already mentioned, it is a deep burrower. It is
  represented by three species, <i>E. cordatum</i>, <i>E. pennatifidum</i>, and <i>E.
  flavescens</i>. The first, described as the type of the Spatangoidea, has a deeply grooved
  anterior ambulacrum. In the remaining two species this ambulacrum is not grooved. <i>E.
  flavescens</i> has only six or seven pairs of pores in the posterior <span class="pagenum"
  id="page556"><span class="smaller">{556}</span></span>petals, <i>E. pennatifidum</i> twelve to
  fourteen. Both come from deeper water than <i>E. cordatum</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Fam. 7. Brissidae.</b>&mdash;Allied to the Spatangidae, but distinguished by sunken petals
  and a peripetalous fasciole.</p>

  <p>Two genera are recorded from the British area, <i>Schizaster</i> and <i>Brissopsis</i>, but the
  first has only been found once in deep water; the second is common. <i>Schizaster</i> has the
  front petals three times as long as the hind ones, and no sub-anal fasciole. <i>Brissopsis</i> has
  the front and hind petals of about the same length, and a sub-anal fasciole. The only British
  species is called <i>B. lyrifera</i>, on account of the fiddle-shaped outline of the peripetalous
  fasciole.</p>

  <p><i>Hemiaster</i> (Fig. 250) in general resembles <i>Schizaster</i>, but the petals are equal in
  length, and the two posterior serve as brood-pouches for the young. This genus is mainly
  Antarctic.</p>

  <p><b>Fossil Echinoidea.</b>&mdash;Echinoidea are well represented in the geological record, and
  form a characteristic element in many fossil faunas. They appear in the Ordovician formation, but
  the first representatives of an existing family (Cidaridae) only appear in the Permian.</p>

  <p>Space will only permit us to treat of the extinct members of the group very briefly. Leaving
  out of sight the representatives of families still living, the fossil Echinoidea may be divided
  into two great groups, viz.<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) Palaeozoic forms, which in some points serve to connect the Endocyclica with the
  primitive Asteroidea.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) Mesozoic forms, which serve to connect the Clypeastroidea and Spatangoidea with the
  Endocyclica.</p>

      interambulacral plates. (After Zittel.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The Palaeozoic forms are often called Palaeoechinoidea, and they are above all distinguished by
  the fact that the number of vertical bands of plates composing the corona is variable, in a word,
  that the corona has not yet acquired a fixed definite constitution. One genus
  (<i>Echinocystites</i>) has the anus outside the apical system. It has four rows of pore-plates in
  each radius, and numerous rows of plates each with a single spine in the interradii. Another
  (<i>Palaeodiscus</i>) has been shown by Sollas<a id="NtA_504" href="#Nt_504"><sup>[504]</sup></a>
  to be in many respects the missing link between Asteroidea and Echinoidea. Inside the plates of
  the corona there is a series of ambulacral plates like those of Asteroidea. The tube-feet in the
  oral portion of the radii seem to have issued between the (outer) ambulacral plates. No anus has
  been detected. All the rest are Endocyclic. The oldest known form, <i>Bothriocidaris</i> (Fig.
  252, A), from the Ordovician, has only one row of interambulacral plates and two of ambulacral; no
  peristome is distinguishable from the corona. The <b>Archaeocidaridae</b> appear in the Devonian.
  They have narrow ambulacra of two rows of pore-plates as in the Cidaridae, but the interambulacra
  consist of many rows, the members of which overlap, and therefore were probably slightly movable,
  as in the Echinothuriidae; the primary tubercles are large, and there is only one on each plate.
  The <b>Melonitidae</b> (Fig. 252, B) appear in the Carboniferous. Each interambulacral plate, of
  which there may be five rows in each interradius, bears numerous small tubercles, and there may be
  four or more vertical rows of pore-plates, though in the genus figured, <i>Palaeoechinus</i>,
  there are only two. The <b>Tiarechinidae</b> are represented by one genus, <i>Tiarechinus</i>,
  with an enormous apical system, from the Triassic of the Tyrol. The interambulacra consist of one
  plate bordering the mouth, three, <span class="pagenum" id="page558"><span
  class="smaller">{558}</span></span>side by side, forming the interradial area of the corona, and
  one large genital plate; the ambulacra, of two rows of pore-plates. This family consists of
  dwarfed forms which probably inhabited the land-locked seas and salt lagoons of the Triassic
  epoch.</p>

  <p>When we recollect that some of the oldest Asteroidea known to us had very narrow arms and
  interradial areas edged by large square marginals, it does not require a very great effort to
  imagine how these marginals could be converted into the vertical rows of the interambulacra, and
  the pointed narrow arms becoming recurved, could have formed the ambulacra. The physiological
  advantage of this will be discussed in the chapter on development.</p>

  <p>True Cidaridae occur in the Permian, and are abundant in all the younger formations. One
  Cretaceous genus, <i>Tetracidaris</i>, has four rows of interambulacral plates near the mouth,
  diminishing to two at the apex. This circumstance renders it probable that the Cidaridae are the
  direct descendants of the Archaeocidaridae. The Saleniidae, Echinothuriidae, and Diadematidae
  appear in the Jurassic, the Echinidae in the Cretaceous, and the Arbaciidae only in the Tertiary
  epoch.</p>

  <p>Turning now to the Mesozoic forms with an excentric anus, there were a number of forms which
  have been grouped together as <b>Holectypoidea</b> which had auricles and teeth and gills,
  although these were only feebly developed, and in which the pore-plates remained separate. The
  periproct was a comparatively large area, and in <i>Pygaster</i>, as in the surviving form
  <i>Pygastrides</i>, it was in contact with the apical system, although outside it. Many of the
  genera were of considerable height in proportion to their length. In <i>Conoclypeus</i> and
  <i>Discoidea</i> the jaws and auricles were very weak. The <b>Echinoconidae</b> have only
  vestigial auricles, and on this account are often definitely grouped with the Spatangoidea, but
  they are closely allied to the Holectypoidea. They are Cretaceous forms of high conical shape
  (<i>Galerites</i>). In <i>Hyboclypus</i> (Fig. 253) all trace of the teeth has disappeared, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page559"><span class="smaller">{559}</span></span>but the periproct is large
  and in contact with the apical system; these forms appeared in the Jurassic. The
  <b>Collyritidae</b>, also Jurassic, had a marginal anus. The apical system was so much elongated
  that two of the ocular plates are widely separated from the other three, two opposite
  interambulacra meeting between them. Unmistakable Spatangoidea (Spatangidae and Ananchytidae)
  appear in the Cretaceous, true Clypeastroidea (<i>Fibularites</i>) in the Cretaceous, the other
  families in the Tertiary.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Reviewing these facts, we see that from the Holectypoidea we can pass by insensible
  steps on the one hand into true Clypeastroidea, and on the other hand into true Spatangoidea. The
  Holectypoidea differed from Endocyclica only in the position of the anus, and the initial step in
  the backward shift of this organ is seen in <i>Pygaster</i>. One result follows from this
  conclusion, that the modification of the dorsal tube-feet into breathing organs, and the
  consequent appearance of petals which accompany the taking on of burrowing habits, were
  independently developed in the Clypeastroidea and Spatangoidea, since these features were absent
  in the more primitive members of both groups.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS IV. HOLOTHUROIDEA</p>

  <p>This class of the Eleutherozoa comprises those sausage-shaped, leathery Echinodermata
  familiarly known as Sea-cucumbers. They are named Holothuroidea from <span title="holothourion"
  class="fsn">&#x1F41;&lambda;&omicron;&theta;&omicron;&#x03CD;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>, an
  animal described by Aristotle, and believed to belong to this class.</p>

  <p>The Holothuroidea resemble Echinoidea in the fact that the radial canals of the water-vascular
  system run backwards and upwards from the ring-canal over the surface of the body, terminating in
  small papillae near the anus, which, as in the Echinoidea Endocyclica, is situated at the upper
  pole of the body. There are, of course, no arms; and a further resemblance to Echinoidea is shown
  by the fact that the ambulacral grooves are represented by closed epineural canals, and that the
  ectoderm consists of long, slender, flagellated cells interspersed with gland-cells, underneath
  which is a plexus consisting of nerve-fibres and small bi-polar ganglion cells. There are,
  however, no spines or pedicellariae; and Holothuroidea differ not only from Echinoidea, but from
  all other Echinodermata, in the vestigial character of their skeleton, which consists merely of
  isolated nodules of calcium carbonate embedded in the skin. The body-wall is provided with
  transverse muscles running across the interradii, and also with powerful longitudinal muscles,
  running along the radii, by means of which worm-like contractions are carried out. Similar
  muscles, though much less developed, occur in the Echinothuriidae, and must have been present in
  many extinct Echinoidea in which the plates of the corona overlapped; and hence it is exceedingly
  probable that from some of these <span class="pagenum" id="page561"><span
  class="smaller">{561}</span></span>early forms, as, for instance, <i>Bothriocidaris</i>,
  Holothuroidea may have been evolved. The <b>muscular body-wall</b> has indeed been as important a
  factor in the evolution and differentiation of the Holothuroidea as the <b>muscular arm</b> in
  that of Ophiuroidea, or the <b>movable spine</b> in the case of Echinoidea.</p>

      <p class="sp0"><span class="sc">Fig. 254.</span>&mdash;<i>Holothuria nigra</i>. <i>t</i>,
      Buccal tentacle or "feeler." &times; &frac12;.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There are about 520 species of living Holothuroidea, and of these about twenty-one have been
  recorded from British waters. One of the best-known of the British species is <i>Holothuria
  nigra</i> (Fig. 254), commonly known as the "Cotton-spinner"; and this we shall take as a type for
  special description. The animal may attain a length of a foot when fully extended, and has a
  diameter of from 3 to 4 inches. It is of a very dark brown colour on one side, which in crawling
  it keeps uppermost, whilst on the lower side it is of a tawny yellow hue. Three of the radii
  (often termed the "trivium") are situated on the lower surface; two (termed the "bivium") on the
  upper surface. The podia are scattered fairly evenly over the whole surface without reference to
  the radii; below they are regular tube-feet provided with suckers, whilst on the upper surface
  they are pointed tentacles, employed only for sensory purposes.</p>

  <p>If the animal be observed alive and in its natural surroundings, a ring of twenty large
  tentacles can be seen surrounding the mouth. These buccal tentacles are in every respect
  comparable with the buccal tube-feet of Ophiuroidea and Spatangoidea, and, like them, are employed
  in shovelling the muddy substratum on which the animal lies into the mouth.</p>

  <p>Ludwig employs the term "feeler" for these buccal tentacles, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page562"><span class="smaller">{562}</span></span>in order to distinguish them from the
  pointed podia scattered over the bivium. This procedure will be adopted here. In the
  Cotton-spinner the feelers, when extended, show a short smooth stem, from the apex of which
  springs a circle of short branches, which are in turn beset with a double row of branchlets,
  themselves branched. Such feelers are said to be shield-shaped.</p>

  <p>A transverse section through the <b>radius</b> of a Sea-cucumber is, in general, like one
  through the radius of a Sea-urchin; the points of difference to be noted are: (<i>a</i>) In the
  Sea-cucumber, beneath the ectoderm, is a thick dermis with small plates scattered in it, instead
  of the whole dermis being calcified, as is the case in the Sea-urchin; (<i>b</i>) the ampulla of
  each podium is connected with the peripheral portion by one canal, not two, as in the case of the
  Sea-urchin; (<i>c</i>) there is a development of coelomic nervous tissue from the outer side of
  the perihaemal canal; (<i>d</i>) internal to the radial water-vascular canal are to be seen
  cross-sections of two great bands of longitudinal muscles, by the contraction of which the body is
  shortened. Lengthening is brought about by the contraction of transverse muscles, which are found
  on the inner side of the body-wall in each interradius; the five sets taken together act like
  circular muscles, or a rubber band, on the incompressible fluid in the body-cavity.</p>

  <p>When the Sea-cucumber is opened by a cut along the left dorsal interradius, the spacious coelom
  is laid open, and lying in it is seen the <b>alimentary canal</b>. This tube is bent on itself, so
  that it has a form like &#x223D; (Fig. 255, B) running backwards to the posterior end of the body,
  then running forwards to near the anterior end, before it finally turns to run backwards to the
  anus. By taking cross-sections of the body at different levels, it can be shown that the
  alimentary canal makes a half-turn round the longitudinal axis (Fig. 255, A). It is suspended by
  bands of membrane, termed "mesenteries," to the body-wall, and of these there are three, the first
  of which (<i>i.e.</i> the one nearest the mouth) is attached to the mid-dorsal interradius (Fig.
  255, A, M<sup>1</sup>), the next to the left dorsal interradius (M<sup>2</sup>), and the last to
  the right ventral interradius (M<sup>3</sup>).</p>

  <p>The alimentary tube shows four regions, which are distinguished as follows:&mdash;(1) A short
  oesophagus with strongly-marked longitudinal folds in its walls; this is separated by a
  constriction from (2) the stomach, a very short region, <span class="pagenum" id="page563"><span
  class="smaller">{563}</span></span>characterised by its strong musculature. Next follows (3) the
  intestine, a thin-walled tube comprising the middle limb and most of the descending and ascending
  limbs. This finally passes into (4) the wide terminal "rectum," or "cloaca," which is connected to
  the body-wall by muscular bands which traverse the coelom (Fig. 256, <span
  class="smaller">10</span>).</p>

  <p>The cells lining the oesophagus resemble ectodermal cells; those lining the stomach are nearly
  all gland-cells, and obviously secrete the digestive juice. The powerful muscles of this portion
  of the gut produce a strong peristalsis which thoroughly mixes the juice with the food, and in the
  thin-walled intestine absorption of the digested material takes place. The extreme thinness of the
  intestinal wall is common to many animals (e.g. <i>Sipunculus</i>, Vol. II. p. <a
  href="#page412">412</a>) which swallow mud and sand for the sake of the organic matter which they
  contain.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The rectum, or cloaca, is one of the most characteristic features in this and most other
  Sea-cucumbers. In addition to the passing of faeces, it is used to pump water in and out, and it
  thus serves as a breathing organ. This pumping is effected by alternate contractions of the
  radiating muscles attaching the cloaca to the body-wall, and of the circular muscles which
  immediately surround it. Two long branched tubes termed <b>Respiratory trees</b> (Fig. 256, <span
  class="smaller">11</span>) open into the cloaca, and into these the inspired water penetrates. The
  finer branches of these gills end in rounded thin-walled swellings termed "ampullae"; and when
  water is forced into these they become tense, and a considerable quantity diffuses through their
  walls, carrying <span class="pagenum" id="page564"><span class="smaller">{564}</span></span>oxygen
  into the fluid which fills the coelom. If a Sea-cucumber be left in a limited quantity of water,
  it will sometimes direct the posterior end upwards until it reaches the surface of the liquid, and
  will pump air into the trees. Besides the trees, other much shorter tubes open into the cloaca,
  termed the <b>Cuvierian organs</b>. These tubes are really the modified basal branches of the
  trees. They are unbranched, and their peritoneum consists of cells which secrete a slime which
  swells up enormously on the addition of sea water. When the Cotton-spinner is strongly irritated,
  it contracts all the muscles of the body-wall, and these, acting on the incompressible fluid in
  the body-cavity, transmit the pressure to the thin rectum, which tears, and allows a portion of
  the viscera to be forced out. The first parts to be rejected are the Cuvierian organs, and the
  cells covering these absorb water, and their contained mucus splits up into a tangle of white
  threads, in which an enemy may be completely ensnared. A large lobster has been seen so enveloped
  with this "cotton" as to be completely incapable of motion. The origin of the name
  "Cotton-spinner" requires no further elucidation. Such self-mutilation, even when it involves not
  only the Cuvierian organs, but the trees and the whole of the intestine, is not necessarily fatal.
  If the animal be left alone, it can regenerate the whole of these organs.</p>

  <p>The <b>water-vascular system</b> in its general features resembles that of the Echinoidea. We
  notice as its first striking peculiarity the modification of the stone-canal. This is often
  multiplied, as in the species (<i>H. tubulosa</i>) represented in Fig. 256, where there are five;
  but whether there is one or many, they do not reach the body-wall, but end each in a swelling
  projecting into and bathed by the coelomic fluid. These swellings are termed "internal
  madreporites." They are pierced by numerous fine ciliated canals, which lead into a space from
  which the stone-canal takes its origin. Both stone-canal and madreporite (especially the latter)
  are stiffened by the deposition of carbonate of lime. In the young Holothurian there is a single
  ciliated pore-canal opening to the exterior and leading into a thin-walled axial sinus, which, as
  Bury<a id="NtA_505" href="#Nt_505"><sup>[505]</sup></a> has shown, is later converted into the
  internal madreporite; the pore-canal, which represents the external madreporite of other
  Echinoderms, disappearing at the same time.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page566"><span class="smaller">{566}</span></span></div>

  <p>This extraordinary modification is the consequence of the habit of forcing water into the
  respiratory trees. The body-cavity is by this means kept tensely filled with fluid, and the
  stone-canal is enabled to draw on it for the supply to the water-vascular system, thus rendering
  the external madreporite supererogatory. A large-stalked sac&mdash;the Polian vesicle (Fig. 256,
  <span class="smaller">4</span>)&mdash;multiplied in many species, hangs down from the
  water-vascular ring and serves as a reservoir of fluid.</p>

  <p>All the podia, including the feelers, have ampullae. In the feelers a semicircular valve is
  situated just where the external part passes into its long ampulla. When this valve is expanded,
  the feeler is moved about by the contraction of its muscles, but when it is contracted, the
  contents of the feeler can flow back into the ampulla, so that the feeler is reduced to an
  insignificant papilla (as in Fig. 254). The interior of the feeler is ciliated, and a current
  seems to flow up one side and down the other, so that this organ, like the dorsal tube-foot of a
  Cake-urchin or Heart-urchin, seems to assist in respiration.</p>

  <p>The <b>nervous system</b> differs from that of Echinoidea in the absence of the pigment spot
  (or so-called eye) on the terminal podium of the radial water-vascular canal. Each podium receives
  a so-called nerve&mdash;really an extension of the radial nerve-cord with its
  ganglion-cells&mdash;and this ends in a plate of sensory epithelium in the sucker of the tube-foot
  or tip of the tentacle, or of each of its branches in the case of the feeler.</p>

  <p>There is a coelomic nervous system developed from the radial perihaemal canals. The
  <b>perihaemal ring</b> is represented in Echinoidea by the lantern coelom, in Holothuroidea in all
  probability by the "buccal sinus," a space intervening between the water-vascular ring and the
  oesophagus. In the outer wall of this are developed ossicles, which constitute the <b>calcareous
  ring</b> found in all<a id="NtA_506" href="#Nt_506"><sup>[506]</sup></a> Sea-cucumbers (Fig. 257,
  A and B). In this ring (Fig. 257, B) are to be distinguished radial and interradial pieces. The
  former are notched at their upper ends, and in all probability represent the auriculae of
  Echinoidea, as the radial nerve-cords pass out over the notches, whilst the interradial pieces
  probably represent a coalesced pair of jaws and their included tooth, since these ossicles develop
  from a single rudiment in the larval Echinoid.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page567"><span class="smaller">{567}</span></span></div>

  <p>The so-called <b>blood system</b> is in its main features similar to that of Echinoidea. It
  consists of a blood-ring surrounding the oesophagus inside the water-vascular ring, and sending
  branches along the stone-canal, and of dorsal and ventral strands accompanying the gut in its
  course. These are best marked in the region of the intestine, where absorption principally takes
  place; in the wall of the stomach they are represented by a delicate plexus which can hardly be
  traced into connexion with the blood-ring. The dorsal "vessel" is situated in a fold of peritoneum
  projecting from the intestinal wall; it gives off branches to the intestine, which unite on its
  surface to form a plexus. In the middle limb of the intestine these branches are grouped into
  tufts, and the fold of peritoneum between successive tufts becomes absorbed; through the holes so
  formed branches of the respiratory tree penetrate, so that the trees cannot be separated from the
  intestine without tearing the dorsal vessel (Fig. 256, <span class="smaller">13</span>).</p>

  <p class="sp3">The <b>genital organs</b> consist of a single group of branched tubes situated on
  the left side of the dorsal mesentery, which converge to open into a short genital duct, which
  leads to a pore situated in the mid-dorsal line, a short distance behind the feelers. From the
  common point of origin of the tubes, the "genital base," as it is called, a worm-shaped genital
  stolon<a id="NtA_507" href="#Nt_507"><sup>[507]</sup></a> extends back along the genital duct
  towards the body-wall. There is no genital rachis.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Classification of Holothuroidea.</b></p>

  <p>The class is in many points of structure exceedingly variable, but many striking variations in
  important organs occur in allied <span class="pagenum" id="page568"><span
  class="smaller">{568}</span></span>species, and even in the same species, and hence are probably
  not of physiological importance. We shall therefore confine our attention mainly to those
  differences in structure which are correlated with differences in habits, and therefore of
  systematic importance. We shall consider in order (1) the feelers; (2) the method of protecting
  these; (3) the rest of the water-vascular system; (4) the gills; and (5) the skeleton.</p>

  <p><b>Feelers.</b>&mdash;These organs have been made the basis of the division of the
  Holothuroidea into orders, and as they are the means by which food is obtained, and are thus of
  first-class physiological importance, this procedure is fully justified. In three orders they have
  the shield-shaped ends described in the case of <i>Holothuria nigra</i>, but in another large
  order (Dendrochirota) they are much branched, and end in a mass of delicate twigs. In another
  order (Synaptida) they are feather-shaped, with two rows only of branches, whilst finally in
  Molpadiida they are simple finger-shaped processes with one or two lateral branches. The number of
  the feelers varies from ten to thirty.</p>

  <p>In the Dendrochirota the entire anterior portion of the body can be introverted into the
  interior, so that in this way the crown of feelers can be effectively protected. The retractor
  muscles are modified portions of the longitudinal muscles of the body-wall, which traverse the
  body-cavity, and are inserted into the radial pieces of the calcareous ring. Similar muscles are
  found in the genus <i>Molpadia</i> and in many of the Synaptida. In Aspidochirota and
  <i>Pelagothuria</i> they are totally wanting, and here the feelers possess long ampullae which
  allow of the tentacles being individually contracted to very small dimensions. These ampullae seem
  to be present in nearly all cases in Molpadiida, and in Synaptida, although in the last-named
  order they are very feebly developed, and must be looked on as vestigial. In Dendrochirota, owing
  to the strongly developed retractors, they would be useless, and so are absent.</p>

  <p><b>Water-Vascular System.</b>&mdash;In Synaptida the radial canals are totally absent in the
  adult, and the only podia are the feelers, which spring directly from the ring-canal. The radial
  canals are present in <i>Pelagothuria</i>, but the feelers are still the only podia; in the
  Molpadiida there are only five small terminal tentacles round the anus in addition to the feelers.
  In the Elasipoda all the podia have pointed ends, but the dorsal podia <span class="pagenum"
  id="page569"><span class="smaller">{569}</span></span>are few, long, and stiff, and often
  coalescent in places to form grotesque or remarkable appendages. In the remaining forms the podia
  of the trivium have always suckers, whilst those of the bivium may or may not be pointed. In
  <i>Psolus</i> the two dorsal radial canals and their podia are totally absent.</p>

  <p><b>Respiratory Trees.</b>&mdash;These are present in Aspidochirota, Dendrochirota, and
  Molpadiida, totally absent in the Synaptida and <i>Pelagothuria</i>, and doubtfully represented in
  a few Elasipoda by a single unbranched outgrowth of the gut.</p>

  <p><b>Skeleton.</b>&mdash;This consists, as explained above, of the scattered deposits in the skin
  and of the calcareous ring. As regards the first, their shape varies immensely, and yet one or two
  principal types characteristic of each of the main divisions can be defined. Thus the Synaptida
  are characterised by wheels, with spokes ending in a hub, and by anchors attached to a plate. The
  Elasipoda have simple St. Andrew's crosses, whilst the Aspidochirota are mainly characterised by
  "stools" (Fig. 257, C) and buckles (Fig. 257, D). The Dendrochirota have a bewildering variety of
  forms; the most characteristic, however, are a right-angled cross and a grating, very similar to
  the buckles of the Aspidochirota, except that in the former there are usually four holes placed
  cross-wise, whilst the buckle has generally two parallel rows of three holes. Since these ossicles
  are the only records we possess of the existence of fossil Holothuroidea, they have been studied
  with great care. The calcareous ring varies very much. The radials are always five (except in
  individuals where there are more than five radii), but the interradials are increased in the
  Synaptida, and in the other orders are in some cases diminished or occasionally suppressed
  altogether. The last is the case in nearly all Elasipoda; here the radials consist of a central
  horizontal piece with two diverging arms at each side. These arms, which can branch repeatedly,
  traverse the adjacent interradii, meeting those of the next radii, so that interradials are in
  most cases entirely absent. The Aspidochirota have usually a ring consisting of small squarish
  ossicles (Fig. 257, B). In the Molpadiida and Dendrochirota the radials are prolonged backwards
  into forked tails, which in some Dendrochirota are broken into a number of small pieces (Fig. 257,
  A), the lower parts of the interradialia being similarly divided.</p>

  <p>The <b>classification</b> of the Holothuroidea is comparatively easy. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page570"><span class="smaller">{570}</span></span>All authors recognise six divisions, and the
  only dispute is as to whether they are to be regarded as families or orders. Ludwig<a id="NtA_508"
  href="#Nt_508"><sup>[508]</sup></a> divides the group into two orders, <b>Paractinopoda</b> and
  <b>Actinopoda</b>, but the first includes only those forms which have lost the radial canals, and
  this is only one step farther in a degeneration, intermediate stages of which can be traced in the
  other divisions. There is really no ground for placing the Paractinopoda in contrast to all the
  other divisions, and the only alternative is to regard the six main divisions as orders, since a
  class must be divided into orders. In the case of only one, however, is a further division into
  families practicable, and therefore each of the others will contain a single family.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order I. Aspidochirota.</b></p>

  <p class="sp3">Holothuroidea with shield-shaped feelers provided with ampullae; with radial canals
  and numerous podia and with respiratory trees. Retractor muscles absent. Nearly a third (158) of
  the species of Holothuroidea belong to this order, but there are only six genera, and of these
  <i>Holothuria</i> includes no less than 109 species. The Aspidochirota seem for the most part to
  live on somewhat firm ground, the surface of which they are continually sweeping with their
  shield-shaped feelers, which brush the adherent organisms into the capacious mouth. Four species
  of <i>Holothuria</i>&mdash;viz. <i>H. intestinalis</i>, <i>H. tremula</i>, <i>H. aspera</i>, and
  <i>H. nigra</i> are recorded from British waters. The first-named is a northern form,
  distinguished by the fact that all its podia have suckers; it is found in the north of Scotland.
  <i>H. tremula</i> is intermediate in structure between <i>H. intestinalis</i> and <i>H. nigra</i>,
  and is found in deep water off our western coasts. <i>H. aspera</i>, remarkable for the radiating
  spines growing out from its ossicles, has been recorded only once from deep water. Of the other
  genera it is only necessary to mention <i>Stichopus</i>, remarkable for the square outline of its
  transverse section, and for the restriction of the ventral tube-feet to the radii; there is also a
  well-marked tapering of the anterior end, so that this genus may be said to have a neck.
  <i>Stichopus</i> is almost entirely confined to tropical waters, and some of its species, as also
  species of the ubiquitous genus <i>Holothuria</i>, as well as many other undetermined species,
  constitute the valuable "Trepang," which is a delicacy much prized <span class="pagenum"
  id="page571"><span class="smaller">{571}</span></span>by the Chinese. The Trepang are caught in
  various parts of the Malay Archipelago. They are cooked in sea water to preserve them, dried in
  the sun, and boiled in fresh water repeatedly, till all the salt is extracted. They are then dried
  and sent to market, where they are used in making soup.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order II. Elasipoda.</b></p>

  <p>Holothuroidea with shield-shaped feelers, destitute of retractor muscles; all the podia have
  more or less pointed ends,<a id="NtA_509" href="#Nt_509"><sup>[509]</sup></a> but there is a
  marked contrast between dorsal and ventral podia, and the ventral surface is flattened so as to
  constitute a creeping sole. No respiratory trees, at most a simple diverticulum of the intestine;
  frequently the primitive external madreporite is retained, and contains several pores.</p>

  <p>A number of spherical sacs containing little spherical calcifications (otocysts) are attached
  to the nerve-ring in some genera. Can these be metamorphosed sphaeridia of Echinoid ancestors?</p>

  <p class="sp3">The first member of this remarkable order to be discovered was <i>Elpidia</i>,
  which was dredged in 1875 by the Swedish Arctic Expedition, and described by Th&eacute;el.<a id="NtA_510"
  href="#Nt_510"><sup>[510]</sup></a> The majority of the known members of the order were discovered
  by the dredging expedition of H.M.S. "Challenger." The species composing it are, with one
  exception, inhabitants of what may be termed the abysmal depths of the sea. The exception alluded
  to (<i>Ilyodaemon maculatus</i>) is confined to the belt between 100 and 150 fathoms in depth. The
  well-marked sole and the absence of suckers point to a life consisting of constant peregrinations
  over <span class="pagenum" id="page572"><span class="smaller">{572}</span></span>the soft ooze
  forming the ocean floor. The ooze forms their food, and as their weight must to a certain extent
  immerse them in it, we can understand why the stiff, long dorsal podia have been specialised as
  respiratory organs, since there are no respiratory trees. These respiratory podia sometimes
  undergo extraordinary development; thus in <i>Peniagone</i> several very long ones cohere to form
  a huge vertical sail, whilst in <i>Psychropotes</i> one or two cohere to form a backwardly
  projecting tail. On the other hand, in <i>Ilyodaemon</i> (Fig. 258) the dorsal podia are numerous
  and slender.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order III. Pelagothuriida.</b></p>

  <p>Holothuroidea with shield-shaped feelers provided with long ampullae which project outwards,
  pushing the skin before them so as to form external appendages, connected at the base by a web.
  Calcifications absent. No retractor muscles. No respiratory trees. The external madreporite is
  retained, but all podia other than the feelers have disappeared, although the radial canals have
  been retained.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This order contains one species, <i>Pelagothuria natans</i>, which is the only
  free-swimming Holothuroid known, the muscular web connecting the freely projecting ampullae being
  the organ of locomotion.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;"><b>Order IV. Dendrochirota.</b></p>

  <p>Holothuroidea with long repeatedly branched feelers terminating in fine pointed twigs. No
  feeler-ampullae; but retractor muscles are present, which can introvert the anterior end of the
  body. Respiratory trees well developed. This order includes twelve genera and over 180 species,
  and, like the Aspidochirota, is of worldwide distribution. So far as can be safely generalised
  from the few species whose habits have been closely observed, it seems that this order is adapted
  to catch swimming prey&mdash;it is an order of fishers. The long branched tentacles are extended
  like the lines of an angler. Their surface is coated with adhesive slime, and before long becomes
  covered with small organisms which have come in contact with it. When a feeler has captured in
  this way a large enough haul, it is turned round and pushed into the mouth, which is closed on it.
  It is then forcibly pulled out, during which process the prey is, so to speak, stripped off it.

  <p><i>Cucumaria</i> is remarkable for being the only genus of Holothuroidea in which the body is
  pentagonal in cross-section. In the majority of its species the tube-feet are confined to two rows
  along each radius, but in a few there are some scattered tube-feet in addition. There are only ten
  buccal tentacles. The species figured (<i>C. crocea</i>) is an Antarctic one which carries the

  tube-feet scattered evenly over the whole surface. In <i>Phyllophorus</i> (Fig. 260) the tentacles
  are more than fifteen, and are disposed in two circles, an inner of smaller and an outer of larger

  absence of the tube-feet, and the small, almost vestigial character of the feelers.
  <i>Trochostoma</i> (Fig. 262) and <i>Caudina</i> are remarkable for the presence of a tail. This
  appendage is in reality only the narrow posterior end of the body, and is especially long in
  <i>Caudina</i>; and observations on a species found off the coast of Maine, U.S.A.,<a id="NtA_511"

  <p>The members of this remarkable order, like those of the preceding one, are burrowers; but
  though their feelers are larger, the rest of their anatomy has undergone much more profound
  modification than that experienced by the Molpadiida. The loss of the radial canals, which must be
  practically functionless in Molpadiida, is not a great step, but the change in the mode of
  respiration is a greater modification. Respiration appears to be effected by diffusion through the
  body-wall, which is always comparatively thin. The circulation of the body-cavity fluid is
  assisted by a number of stalked, ciliated cups placed on the mesenteries near the line of their
  insertion on the body-wall. In dealing with Asteroidea it was pointed out that the ends of the
  tube-feet are the only places where numerous sense-hairs are to be found, and which, therefore,
  can be called sense-organs. This is true generally throughout Echinodermata. Now in Synaptida,
  where the tube-feet are lost, the surface of the body has scattered over it little sense-organs
  consisting of hillocks of ectoderm with an aggregation of sense-cells. These may be regarded as
  representing the discs of the missing tube-feet. One is involuntarily reminded by the ciliated
  cups and scattered sense-organs of the ciliated urns and sense-organs of the Sipunculidae, which
  lead a similar life; and taking into consideration the general superficial likeness in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page577"><span class="smaller">{577}</span></span>appearance of the two
  groups, the epigram is almost justified that "if the Synaptida were not extremely careful they
  would become Gephyrea."</p>

  <p>This order is represented in British waters by three species of the genus <i>Synapta</i>, which
  is remarkable for possessing, as ossicles, only the peculiar anchors attached to anchor plates.
  The present author has dug up the commonest species (<i>S. inhaerens</i>) from its burrows in the
  sand at low water in the Clyde. These animals seem to seek their food at the surface; the
  feather-shaped feelers are used to seize small algae and zoophytes, of which the food apparently
  consists. If seized, <i>S. inhaerens</i> readily amputates the posterior part of the body, whilst
  the head with its feelers immediately buries itself. The other genera of the order (except
  <i>Anapta</i>) are characterised by the possession of wheels with spokes as their characteristic
  ossicle, as the names <i>Trochodota</i>, <i>Trochoderma</i>, <i>Acanthotrochus</i> bear
  witness.</p>

  <p>The only fossil remains of Holothuroidea consist of isolated ossicles&mdash;wheels, gratings,
  anchors, etc.&mdash;which first make their appearance in the Carboniferous limestone and tell us
  practically nothing of the evolution of the group. From a comparison with one another of the
  living families, certain conclusions can be drawn. The Aspidochirote feeler and the method of
  using it recall forcibly the shape and function of the buccal tube-feet of Spatangoidea. It is
  probably safe to assume that it is the primitive form from which the other forms of feeler have
  been derived. Secondly, the anal respiration and the curious internal madreporite have been
  developed in correlation with one another, and are like nothing found elsewhere among the
  Eleutherozoa. Hence we may with high probability assume a Protoholothuroid stock with
  shield-shaped feelers but devoid of respiratory trees, and with an external madreporite. From this
  stock the Elasipoda developed by migrating into deeper water, whilst the Pelagothuriida sprang
  from the same root by taking to swimming; the Aspidochirota constituting the main line. The
  Dendrochirota were developed from a stock with respiratory trees and internal madreporite&mdash;in
  a word, from Aspidochirota. From them the Synaptida and the Molpadiida have developed as offshoots
  at different periods through taking to a burrowing life. These relationships are shown by the
  following diagram<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">SUB-PHYLUM II. PELMATOZOA</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Pelmatozoa</span> differ from the <span class="sc">Eleutherozoa</span> in
  several important respects. They are fixed (at any rate in the young stage) by the centre of the
  aboral surface, and this portion of the body usually takes on the form of a stem supported by a
  definite series of ossicles, so that we can discriminate a "calyx"&mdash;the main part of the
  body&mdash;from the "stem." Further, the podia and the ambulacral grooves seem to be always
  covered with powerful cilia, which are employed in producing a current which sweeps small
  organisms to the mouth. The podia are never locomotor in function; their use is similar to that of
  the tentacles on the lophophore of Polyzoa and Brachiopoda.</p>

  <p>The living Pelmatozoa are very few in number compared with the extinct forms. It may with
  justice be said that the group is nearly extinct; indeed, out of its five classes one alone, and
  that the most highly specialised class, survives till the present day. Now we have already seen
  that, in the case of the Eleutherozoa, if the annectant fossil types were taken into
  consideration, the definition of the classes would be difficult, so that it is not to be wondered
  at if the classes of the Pelmatozoa are also somewhat difficult to define; and it must be added
  that this difficulty is not only due to the fact that intermediate types occasionally occur, but
  also to our ignorance of the functions of many structures found in fossil types, speculations
  regarding which are to be received with caution. Bearing in mind, then, the provisional nature
  <span class="pagenum" id="page580"><span class="smaller">{580}</span></span>of the classification,
  we may give the diagnoses of the principal divisions as follows<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>Class I. <span class="sc">Crinoidea</span>.&mdash;Pelmatozoa provided typically with a
  well-marked stem; calyx consisting of an aboral "patina" of two or three circles of plates, and a
  flexible "tegmen" or oral surface with small plates or none; radial canals supported by long
  branched arms, which are developed as direct prolongations of the uppermost circle of plates in
  the patina.</p>

  <p>Class II. <span class="sc">Thecoidea</span> (Jaekel) = <span class="sc">Edrioasteroidea</span>
  (Bather).&mdash;Pelmatozoa without a stalk, fixed to the substratum by the whole aboral surface.
  The radial canals run out over the oral surface in grooves, which are closed by specially modified
  plates; but there are no arms of any kind.</p>

  <p>Class III. <span class="sc">Carpoidea</span> (Jaekel).&mdash;Pelmatozoa with a well-developed
  stalk. The radial canals and their branches are devoid of a skeleton, and either produce no
  modifications at all on the skeleton of the calyx, or at most are supported by short horn-like
  outgrowths of some of its plates.</p>

  <p>Class IV. <span class="sc">Cystoidea</span>.&mdash;Pelmatozoa which typically possess a
  well-developed stalk, a sac-like calyx contracted at the mouth and covered with plates, some of
  which are pierced with pores or slits; the radial canals, though they may for part of their course
  run over the surface in grooves, have their terminal portions supported by free unbranched arms
  ("fingers").</p>

  <p class="sp3">Class V. <span class="sc">Blastoidea</span>.&mdash;Pelmatozoa provided with a
  well-developed stalk and ovoid bud-like calyx. From the mouth the radial canals run backwards over
  the calyx, as in Echinoidea, but they give rise to numerous lateral branches, which are supported
  by free unbranched arms ("fingers"). Special respiratory organs occur on the interradial areas in
  the form of parallel folds called "hydrospires."</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS I. CRINOIDEA</p>

  <p>This is the only class which has living representatives. There are twelve recent genera, of
  which eight retain the stalk throughout life; the remaining four lose it when adult, retaining
  only a stump, termed the "centro-dorsal," covered with fixing organs ("cirri"). The stalked forms
  are confined to considerable depths, and can only be obtained by deep dredging, whereas many of
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page581"><span class="smaller">{581}</span></span>stalkless forms
  are comparatively common. We shall select as type for special description the common Feather-star,
  <i>Antedon rosacea</i> (<i>bifida</i>), which can be dredged in depths of ten fathoms off the
  south-west coast of England.</p>

  <div class="ac w80 fcenter itp05 sp2">

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The animal consists of a small flattened calyx, from which radiate out ten long delicate arms,
  each fringed with a double series of short branches called "pinnules." In the centre of the aboral
  surface can be seen the centre-dorsal plate (Fig. 265, <i>c</i>), a knob-like stump of the
  broken-off stem, covered with small whip-like outgrowths called "cirri," by means of which the
  animal is anchored to the substratum (Fig. 265, <i>cir</i>). When <i>Antedon</i> is disturbed it
  relaxes its hold, and swims by graceful muscular movements of the arms. These are arranged in five
  pairs, and the corresponding members (right and left) of all the pairs are bent and relaxed
  together. On coming to rest the animal reattaches itself by means of the cirri. These are composed
  of cylindrical ossicles joined to one another by muscles, and they can thus act as efficient
  grasping organs. In the centre of the oral surface, which is termed the "tegmen," and is soft,
  flexible, and without visible calcifications, is situated the mouth, surrounded by five short
  triangular flaps called "oral valves." In the intervals between these valves, grooves radiate from
  the mouth which bifurcate at the points of origin of each pair of arms, and are continued over
  their surfaces. These grooves correspond to the ambulacral grooves of Asteroidea, and to the
  epineural canals of the other classes of Eleutherozoa. At each side of each groove <span
  class="pagenum" id="page582"><span class="smaller">{582}</span></span>are to be found a series of
  podia in the form of delicate finger-like processes, which serve only for respiration and for
  producing a current of water, their surfaces, like that of the grooves between them, being covered
  with powerful cilia. The anus is at the extremity of a little knob called the anal papilla,
  situated in one of the interradii (Fig. 264, <i>an</i>).</p>

  <p>As in Ophiuroidea, the ectoderm cells have disappeared over the whole surface of the body,
  except the grooves and the podia, the only trace of their former existence being a cuticle with
  adherent nuclei. Pedicellariae are unknown in all Pelmatozoa; and spines have only been described
  from one fossil species of Crinoid. Beneath the cuticle is the dermis, having the composition
  described in the case of <i>Asterias rubens</i>; this on the aboral side of the calyx gives rise
  to the "patina," consisting of plates, in part movable on one another, in part immovably fused
  together. Those visible from the outside are (1) the centro-dorsal ossicle, from which the cirri
  spring; (2) five columns of ossicles termed radials (Fig. 266, <i>R<sup>1</sup></i>,
  <i>R<sup>2</sup></i>, <i>R<sup>3</sup></i>); each column consists of three radials, extending from
  the centro-dorsal to the origin of a pair of arms. The uppermost radial in each column bears two
  facets for the articulation of these arms. Each arm is supported by a series of "brachial
  ossicles" (<i>Br</i>).</p>

  </div>

  <p>It is evident, both from the number of ambulacral grooves and of the columns of radials, that
  <i>Antedon</i> has only five radii, and each pair of arms must be regarded as having arisen by the
  bifurcation of a primitive arm. This is proved to be true by <span class="pagenum"
  id="page583"><span class="smaller">{583}</span></span>a study of the development, and it can
  further be shown that the arms fork repeatedly; but in these further bifurcations one fork remains
  short, and forms a pinnule, whilst the other continues the arm. Thus the arm, instead of being a
  single axis, is really a series of axes&mdash;in a word, it is a "sympodium."</p>

  <p>If in the case of any bifurcation the two forks were to develop equally, the number of arms in
  that ray would be doubled, and this actually happens in the case of other species of
  <i>Antedon</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Digestive System.</b>&mdash;The mouth leads through a short vertical oesophagus into an
  enlarged stomach, which lies horizontally curved around the axis of the calyx. The stomach is
  succeeded by a short intestine, which leads into the anal papilla. Both oesophagus and stomach are
  ciliated, and the food consists of minute organisms, swept into the mouth by the current produced
  by the cilia covering the ambulacral grooves and podia; the ten arms may indeed be compared to a
  net spread out in the water to catch swimming prey.</p>

  <p>The <b>water-vascular system</b> consists of a ring closely surrounding the mouth, from which
  radial canals are given off which underlie the ambulacral grooves and bifurcate with them. The
  podia have no ampullae, but muscular strands traverse the cavities of the radial canals, and that
  of the ring-canal, and by their action water can be forced into the podia, which are thus
  extended. Numerous stone-canals hang down from the ring-canal, and open freely into the coelom;
  they do not, as in Holothuroidea (where the same arrangement occurs), end in sieve-like
  madreporites. The tegmen, <i>i.e.</i> the ventral surface of the calyx, is pierced by a number of
  isolated pores lined by ciliated cells, which suck in water. In the oldest Pelmatozoa there seems
  to have been a regular madreporite. In the larva of <i>Antedon</i> there is but one pore-canal,
  which, as in most Eleutherozoa, leads into a special section of the coelom, the "axial sinus,"
  embedded in the body-wall, with which also the single stone-canal communicates; but later the
  division between the axial sinus and the rest of the coelom breaks down, and then the pore-canals
  and stone-canals become multiplied independently of each other (Fig. 266, <i>m.p</i>, <i>p.c</i>,
  and <i>st.c</i>).</p>

  <p><b>Nervous System.</b>&mdash;In the young stalked form the nervous system, as in other
  Echinoderms, consists of a ring round the <span class="pagenum" id="page584"><span
  class="smaller">{584}</span></span>mouth, from which radial cords are given off which run under
  the ambulacral grooves (Fig. 266, <i>nerv.rad.v</i>).</p>

  <p>The fibres of this nervous system are, as in Asteroidea, immediately beneath the bases of the
  ectoderm cells. A large band of fibres is given off to each podium, which is covered with minute
  elevations, each with pointed sense-hairs in the centre. As the animal grows, another nervous
  system makes its appearance, which is developed from the coelomic wall, the cells of certain
  tracts of which multiply and bud off ganglion cells from which the fibres grow out.</p>

  <p>This "aboral nervous system," as it is called, has its centre in the "chambered organ" (Fig.
  266, <i>chamb</i>), which is embedded in the centro-dorsal ossicle, and is roofed over by a plate
  called the "rosette." This represents the five coalesced "basals," a ring of plates which in other
  forms alternate with the lowest radials, and it intervenes between these and the centro-dorsal.
  The chambered organ consists of a ring of five vesicles, which have originated as pouches of the
  aboral coelom (Fig. 266, <i>chamb</i>). The walls of these vesicles develop nervous matter; from
  them radiate out five great cords, deeply embedded in the <span class="pagenum" id="page585"><span
  class="smaller">{585}</span></span>plates of the patina. These cords rapidly fork, and one
  division of each of two adjacent cords enters the lowest radial. In the third radial all the cords
  are connected by a commissure which runs completely round the calyx. Each of the cords in the
  third radial forks again, and one branch of each cord enters each of the two arms connected with
  it, and the two branches entering an arm coalesce to form a single cord. In the arms, as in the
  calyx, the cords are deeply embedded in the ossicles, but branches extend to the ventral surface
  of the arms and here unite to form two longitudinal cords, one on each side of the groove. In the
  tegmen these cords are connected by an outer nerve-ring, branches from which join the ectodermal
  nerve-ring already described.</p>

  <p>The researches first of W. B. Carpenter<a id="NtA_512" href="#Nt_512"><sup>[512]</sup></a> and
  then of Marshall<a id="NtA_513" href="#Nt_513"><sup>[513]</sup></a> have proved that it is the
  aboral nervous system which really controls the movements of the animal. If the chambered organ is
  destroyed by cautery, the whole movements of the animal are paralysed; but it will carry out its
  characteristic swimming movements just as well if the whole tegmen with the ambulacral nerve-ring
  and the whole of the alimentary canal are torn away. The commissure in the third radials
  co-ordinates the movements of the arms. If it is cut they move independently of one another. The
  position of the radial cords inside the ossicles is gradually acquired. At first they are
  gutter-like evaginations of the coelom; by upgrowth of their sides the gutters become canals, and
  are then surrounded by calcified tissue. The cirri have each a cord traversing them which
  originates from the chambered organ.</p>

  <p><b>Coelom.</b>&mdash;In the young stalked form the coelom consists of the water-vascular system
  ("hydrocoel"), and underlying it an oral coelom, separated from an aboral coelom by a horizontal
  mesentery. As the animal grows, this horizontal mesentery becomes largely absorbed, and the coelom
  becomes everywhere traversed by cellular cords (trabeculae), which are later calcified.</p>

  <p>Both oral and aboral coelom become, like the hydrocoel, bent into hoops, and along the axis of
  the aboral coelom a cord of germ-cells is developed, which constitutes the "genital stolon." The
  chambered organ is developed from the aboral coelom, and <span class="pagenum" id="page586"><span
  class="smaller">{586}</span></span>in the centre of its five chambers a median pocket grows down
  into the centro-dorsal, along the side of which is an extension of the genital stolon. In the arms
  the mesentery separating the extensions of the oral and aboral coelom persists; the oral extension
  consists of two parallel canals called "subtentacular" (Fig. 267, <i>s.c</i>), whilst the aboral
  space is termed the "coeliac" canal (Fig. 267, <i>c.c</i>). In the tip of the pinnule, that is to
  say at the extremity of a ramification of the arm, the coeliac and subtentacular canals
  communicate. As portions of the lining of both canals are ciliated, a circulation of the coelomic
  fluid is thus kept up. The <b>genital stolon</b> gives rise at the level of the remnant of the
  horizontal mesentery in the disc to a circular genital rachis, whence cords pass down the arms in
  the tissue separating subtentacular and coeliac canals (Fig. 267, <i>g.r</i>). Each cord is
  contained in a special tube, the "genital canal," which is probably developed in the same way as
  the aboral sinus of the Eleutherozoa, <i>i.e.</i> as a special sheltering outgrowth of the coelom
  (Fig. 267, <i>g.c</i>). In the pinnule the rachis swells out into a genital organ, from which a
  short duct is developed when the organ is mature. The eggs are large (3 mm. in diameter), and
  adhere for a considerable period of their development to the pinnules.</p>

  <p>The <b>muscles</b> of <i>Antedon</i> are of two kinds. Those of the water-vascular system are,
  as in Eleutherozoa, basal outgrowths of the cells forming the walls of the system. The muscles
  moving the joints of the arms appear to be modifications of connective-tissue cells. When the
  brachials are isolated their terminal faces, strikingly long, recall those of Ophiuroid vertebrae.
  There is a ventral groove for the coelomic canal. Above this groove the face is divided by ridges
  into four areas for attachment of the muscles. Dorsal to this is the pit for the strong ligament
  which binds the ossicles together; then comes the canal for the aboral nerve-cord, whilst dorsal
  to this is the pit for what is called the "dorsal elastic ligament." The theory underlying this
  name is that the muscles bend the arms ventrally, and the ligament by its elasticity restores them
  to their places; but there seems reason to believe that the "ligament" is really a dorsal muscle.
  It is particularly to be noted that similar muscles occur between the first and second radials,
  proving that the primary arm really begins with the first radial. The second and third radials, as
  also the first two ossicles and certain others of each arm, are closely united by calcified
  fibres, and this kind of union is called a "syzygy" (Fig. 265, <i>syz</i>). The cirri have all
  their ossicles united by muscular attachment, and can move rapidly.</p>

  <p>The <b>blood system</b> (see pp. <a href="#page449">449-451</a>) forms a ring consisting of a
  network of strings round the oesophagus. This is termed the "labial plexus." From this cords can
  be traced to the wall of the stomach and to the surface of the genital stolon. The assertion that
  radial strands intervene between the ectodermic nerve-cord and the radial water-vascular canal,
  though usually made, does not appear to be justified, since what is termed the vessel appears to
  be a crevice formed by shrinkage in preservation.</p>

  <p>The process of respiration is doubtless largely carried out by the podia, but it must be
  assisted by the constant instreaming of fresh sea-water through the pore-canals. The process of
  <b>excretion</b> has not been directly observed in <i>Antedon</i>, but structures called "sacculi"
  may be connected with this function. These are spherical masses of amoebocytes embedded in the
  tegmen. During life they are colourless, but after death they become coloured, showing that they
  secrete a peculiar compound. These sacculi abound in the disc, and a row of them is to be found at
  each side of the ambulacral groove in the arms. When, as in <span class="pagenum"
  id="page588"><span class="smaller">{588}</span></span>tropical species, the groove is supported by
  side-plates, these are notched for the reception of the sacculi.</p>

  <p>Turning now to survey the group Crinoidea as a whole, lack of space forces us to confine our
  attention mainly to the living forms. These differ amongst themselves chiefly in the following
  points: (1) the condition of the stem; (2) the structure of the calyx; (3) what is intimately
  connected with this, the method of branching of the arms; and (4) the length of the alimentary
  canal.</p>

  <p><b>Condition of the Stem.</b>&mdash;This is represented by a centro-dorsal stump in
  <i>Antedon</i> and most of its allies, but in <i>Actinometra</i> it becomes a flat plate, and in
  some species in old age all the cirri drop off. In <i>Uintacrinus</i> and <i>Marsupites</i>
  (fossil genera) there is no trace of cirri. In Pentacrinidae there is a long stem, pentagonal in
  cross-section, in which alternate ossicles carry whorls of cirri; in Rhizocrinidae the stem
  consists of compressed ossicles, elliptical in section, bearing cirri only at the rooting tip,
  whilst in <i>Hyocrinus</i> the stem is made up of cylindrical ossicles, cirri being apparently
  absent. Finally, in <i>Holopus</i> the stem is represented by an uncalcified leathery outgrowth
  from the calyx.</p>

  <p><b>Skeleton of Calyx and Arm.</b>&mdash;In living Crinoidea, with the doubtful exceptions of
  <i>Holopus</i> and <i>Hyocrinus</i>, the calyx is supposed to be built up originally of four
  whorls of plates, viz. "infra-basals," "basals," "radials," and "orals," the last named forming
  the skeleton of the oral valves round the mouth. In the two exceptions named there is no certain
  evidence of the existence of infra-basals. In living forms the infra-basals coalesce with the
  uppermost joint of the stem; the basals remain large and conspicuous, though they are fused into a
  ring in Rhizocrinidae, <i>Atelecrinus</i>, and <i>Thaumatocrinus</i>, whilst in Pentacrinidae this
  ring is nearly, and in <i>Antedon</i> and its allies completely, hidden when the calyx is viewed
  from the outside. In <i>Hyocrinus</i> the basals are represented by three ossicles. The lowest
  radials are an important element in the patina in every case, but the upper radials, the incipient
  portions of the arms, may be incorporated in the calyx (<i>Pentacrinus</i>, <i>Antedon</i>) or may
  be free (Rhizocrinidae and <i>Hyocrinus</i>); in <i>Metacrinus</i> there are five to eight radials
  in each column, all incorporated.</p>

  <p>The oral plates are very large in <i>Hyocrinus</i>, <i>Holopus</i>, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page589"><span class="smaller">{589}</span></span><i>Thaumatocrinus</i>, small in
  <i>Rhizocrinus</i>, vestigial or absent in <i>Bathycrinus</i>, and completely absorbed in
  <i>Antedon</i>. In addition to these main elements, in many species small accessory plates are
  developed (<i>a</i>) at the sides of the ambulacral groove, over which they can close down (many
  species of <i>Antedon</i>, <i>Hyocrinus</i>, <i>Holopus</i>, Rhizocrinidae, some species of
  Pentacrinidae); these are "covering plates," and correspond in function to the adambulacrals of
  Asteroidea; (<i>b</i>) supporting the sides of the groove and corresponding to the ambulacrals of
  Asteroidea;<a id="NtA_514" href="#Nt_514"><sup>[514]</sup></a> these are "side-plates," and the
  covering plates articulate with them; (<i>c</i>) on the surface of the tegmen; these are the
  interradial plates, which in <i>Thaumatocrinus</i> alone among recent forms, but in many fossil
  forms, are continued into the patina, where they separate the radial plates.</p>

  <p><b>Mode of Branching of the Arms.</b>&mdash;All modern Crinoids have pinnules, and this, as has
  already been explained, is due to a suppressed dichotomy. The extent of the suppression determines
  the number of arms, which varies within the same genus.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal.</b>&mdash;In <i>Hyocrinus</i> there is no dilatation which could be called
  a stomach; in <i>Actinometra</i> the mouth is excentric, and the anal papilla occupies the centre
  of the tegmen. The intestine is elongated, and describes several turns round the papilla before
  ending in the anus.</p>

  <p>The <b>classification</b> of Crinoidea cannot properly be considered without taking account of
  fossil forms, but to do so at all adequately is impossible on account of limitations of space.
  Less regret may be felt because the three specialists in this branch, viz. Bather in England,
  Springer in America, and Jaekel in Germany, come to fundamentally different conclusions on the
  subject. If we confine our attention to living forms we may, with P. H. Carpenter,<a id="NtA_515"
  href="#Nt_515"><sup>[515]</sup></a> select the stem as the basis of classification. As the method
  of gaining food is the same in all cases, the Crinoidea have probably split on the method of
  attachment to the substratum. These families&mdash;it is impossible, in view of the greater range
  of variety in fossils, to dignify them with the name of orders&mdash;are as follow<span

  or completely hidden. Orals absent, but side-plates in the ambulacral grooves. Two recent genera,
  <i>Pentacrinus</i> (<i>Isocrinus</i>), with three radials in each column; <i>Metacrinus</i>, with

  stem is broken in two and the animals, like <i>Antedon</i>, swim by movements of the arms,
  dragging a large part of the stem after them, by which they effect temporary attachment. As in
  other stalked forms, the cavities of the chambered organ are prolonged into canals which traverse

  described; many tropical species have numerous arms and often side-plates and covering plates.
  <i>Actinometra</i> is distinguished by its excentric mouth, and by the fact that the centro-dorsal
  is flat and has cirri only round its edges; <i>Atelecrinus</i> has an acorn-shaped centro-dorsal,
  and the basals are externally visible; <i>Eudiocrinus</i> differs from <i>Antedon</i> only in
  having five arms; <i>Promachocrinus</i> is a remarkable form, having ten radii (this is a unique
  feature in Crinoidea); finally, <i>Thaumatocrinus</i> has basals externally visible, large
  persistent orals and interradial plates, and in addition a short free appendage of several plates
  on the anal interradius. <i>Antedon</i> and <i>Actinometra</i> are almost world-wide. Six species
  of the first have been recorded from British waters, of which the commonest is <i>Antedon
  rosacea</i>; four others are distinguished by having longer cirri, and do not seem to be well
  defined; but <i>A. eschrichtii</i>, a northern form, is larger, and is distinguished by having
  long proximal pinnules. The other genera are rare, and occur in deep water.</p>

  <p>When we turn to survey <b>fossil Crinoidea</b>, we are met with a bewildering variety of forms
  ranging from the Lower Cambrian to the present day. As already mentioned, there is no agreement
  amongst experts as to how they should be classified. Bather makes the fundamental cleavage depend
  on the possession of two whorls of plates in the base (Fig. 274), or of only one whorl. These two
  divisions he calls <span class="sc">Dicyclica</span> and <span class="sc">Monocyclica</span>
  respectively. He admits that in many forms allied to Dicyclica the infra-basals have disappeared;
  these he terms "pseudomonocyclic" forms, and believes that he is able to discriminate them from
  true Monocyclica.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The present author is utterly unable to believe that the Crinoidea diverged into
  two groups on what is a trifling point of meristic variation comparable to the varying number of
  rows of plates in the interradial areas of the older Echinoidea; and he is equally sceptical as to
  the validity of Jaekel's division of the group into <span class="sc">Cladocrinoidea</span> and
  <span class="sc">Pentacrinoidea</span>, leading to the view that organs like pinnules represent
  totally different structures in different groups. Wachsmuth and Springer adopt as bases of
  classification the extent to which the arms and their branches are incorporated in the disc, and
  they recognise three main divisions: <span class="sc">Inadunata</span>, in which the arms are
  completely free from the calyx; <span class="sc">Articulata</span>, in which the arms are partly
  incorporated but the tegmen remains flexible; and finally <span class="sc">Camerata</span>, in
  which the arms and their first branches are largely incorporated in the cup; the tegmen is
  converted into a rigid dome and the ambulacral grooves on it become closed, as does the mouth, by
  the meeting of overarching folds; the grooves remaining, of course, open in the distal portions of
  the arms (Fig. 273). This classification, founded as it is on physiological factors, seems to the
  present author more satisfactory. Speaking generally, the points in which fossil Crinoids may
  differ from living genera are: (1) the total absence or irregular nature of the branching in the
  arms, so that pinnules may be said to be absent; (2) the closure of the ambulacral grooves and
  mouth already alluded to, and (3) the adhesion of the arms in the same ray to produce net-like
  structures (<i>Crotalocrinus</i>, Fig. 274), or a fan-shaped structure (<i>Petalocrinus</i>); (4)
  the frequent presence of two rows of brachials in one arm (biserial structure); (5) the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page596"><span class="smaller">{596}</span></span>development of an enormous
  anal tube, so large that in extreme cases (<i>Eucalyptocrinus</i>) the arms may be lodged in
  grooves of it.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS II. THECOIDEA (EDRIOASTEROIDEA, <span
  class="sc">Bather</span>)</p>

  <p>These remarkable Pelmatozoa are the most primitive known. They have sac-like or sometimes
  cushion-shaped or even disc-shaped bodies, covered with numerous irregular plates without any
  symmetry in their arrangement. There is no stem, but when they are fixed this is effected by an
  adhesion of the aboral pole. There are no arms, but on the upper surface is to be seen the
  impression of five ambulacral grooves radiating from a central mouth. These grooves are bordered
  by covering plates, which in the earliest form (<i>Stromacystis</i>) are seen to be slight
  modifications of the plates covering the upper surface of the body, but in the later genera (Fig.
  275, <i>Thecocystis</i>) become specialised. The anus is situated on the side, as is also the
  madreporite. It has been suggested that Eleutherozoa were derived from this group; that
  individuals were occasionally overturned by the waves or currents, and in this way compelled to
  use their podia for locomotion. When Eleutherozoa, however, have a fixed stage in their
  development, they are fixed by the oral, not the aboral, surface, and hence can have no close
  affinity to Thecoidea. Thecoidea begin in the Middle Cambrian, but according to Jaekel impressions
  in the Lower Cambrian, referred to Medusae, may be casts of this group.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS III. CARPOIDEA</p>

  <p>Pelmatozoa with a well-developed stem; body bilaterally compressed; only two rays apparently
  developed. These are indicated only by grooves radiating from the mouth; but in <span
  class="pagenum" id="page597"><span class="smaller">{597}</span></span>some cases slight horn-like
  outgrowths of some of the plates of the calyx may support prolongations of the grooves.</p>

  <p>This group, which, like the foregoing, commences in the Cambrian, is perhaps more primitive
  than the Thecoidea in showing less influence of the water-vascular system on the skeleton; but in
  the presence of a differentiated stem and the development of only two rays, it is more
  differentiated. The anus is on one of the flat sides, covered with a flat plate acting as a valve.
  The members of this group were formerly confounded with Cystoidea, from which they differ in the
  absence of the characteristic pores. <i>Trochocystis</i>, the genus figured, is devoid of any
  horn-like outgrowths of the calyx.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS IV. CYSTOIDEA</p>

  <p>Pelmatozoa with respiratory organs in the form of "diplopores" or "pore-rhombs." In a great
  many cases there is a stalk, but in other cases this is atrophied, and the animal is attached by
  the base of the calyx. The radial canals run for a shorter or longer distance over the calyx, but
  the plates of the calyx themselves are not modified for them. Either they run in simple grooves,
  or they are protected by a special series of plates lying above the plates of the calyx. The
  terminal portions of the radial canals are in all cases free, supported by unbranched arms
  consisting usually of a double row of ossicles. These arms are termed "fingers."</p>

  <p>It will be gathered from the description just given that the fingers and the respiratory organs
  distinguish Cystoidea from <span class="pagenum" id="page598"><span
  class="smaller">{598}</span></span>the two foregoing classes. Formerly this class was a
  lumber-room in which were placed all primitive irregular Pelmatozoa. The labours of Jaekel<a
  id="NtA_516" href="#Nt_516"><sup>[516]</sup></a> have, however, dispelled the mist which enveloped
  this group, and in his monograph all that can be extracted both from superficial examination and
  dissection of these fossils is contained. It seems possible to the present author that the class
  may eventually require to be divided into two, corresponding to the two main divisions which
  Jaekel recognises, viz. <span class="sc">Dichoporita</span>, with pectinated rhombs, and <span
  class="sc">Diploporita</span>, with diplopores.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The pore-rhombs of the Dichoporita (indicated in Fig. 277 by the small parallel lines crossing
  the boundaries of the plates) were, according to Jaekel, nothing but a series of folds of thin
  integument projecting into the interior, the outer opening of which in most cases adhered in the
  middle, leaving two pores connected by a groove. The inner boundaries of the folds are sometimes
  preserved, but in many cases they were entirely devoid of calcification, and so were lost. The
  radial vessels either branched a great deal, giving rise to a multitude of fingers, or, as in
  <i>Echinosphaerites</i> (Fig. 277), there were a few long fingers supporting a reduced number of
  radial canals. In some cases the calyx can be analysed into a regular series of cycles of plates,
  consisting of basals, orals, and three intervening whorls, thus including one more ring than the
  calyx of Crinoidea. Jaekel regards this as a primitive arrangement, believing that the
  irregularity seen in <i>Echinosphaerites</i> secondary. This is a doubtful hypothesis.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page599"><span class="smaller">{599}</span></span></div>

  <p>The diplopores of the Diploporita appear to consist of two canals traversing the body-wall,
  opening close together into a common pit externally, but diverging internally. Since in some
  cases, as in <i>Aristocystis</i> (Fig. 278), this common pit is proved to have been closed
  externally by a very delicate layer of calcification, it is probable that the pores represent in
  other cases the points of origin of finger-like gills similar to those of Asteroidea. Where they
  were closed by calcification this was so thin and porous that the diffusion through it sufficed
  for respiration. Jaekel regards the Diploporita as a group derived from Dichoporita, but this
  seems to be extremely doubtful.</p>

  <p class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.4ex;">CLASS V. BLASTOIDEA</p>

  <p>Pelmatozoa with respiratory organs in the form of longitudinal calcified folds, termed
  "hydrospires," radiating from the mouth. Stem well developed; calyx regular, consisting of a whorl
  of basals surmounted by a whorl of forked radiais, in the clefts of which lay the recumbent radial
  water-vascular vessels, supported each on a special plate ("lancet plate"), and giving off two
  rows of branches supported by short fingers (Fig. 279). Side-plates and covering plates were also
  developed; five orals ("deltoids") completed the calyx. The anus was at the side, just beneath one
  of the orals.</p>

  <p>The hydrospires, which are the great characteristic of the class, are seen in section in Fig.
  279, B (<i>hyd</i>). They consist of a varying number of parallel folds on each side of each
  "pseudambulacrum," as the lancet plate with its adhering side-plates and covering plates has been
  termed. In the most primitive genus, <i>Codaster</i>, they appear to have opened directly to the
  exterior, and to have been placed at right angles to the lines of union of the radial and oral
  plates, just like the grooves of a pectinated rhomb. In more modified forms, such as
  <i>Pentremites</i> and <i>Granatocrinus</i> (Fig. 279), the outer openings were overarched <span
  class="pagenum" id="page600"><span class="smaller">{600}</span></span>by the extension of the
  side-plates of the radial vessel, and the whole group of folds has a common opening near the
  mouth; indeed, in the highest form there is one common "spiracle" for the two groups of folds in
  an interradius, which in one interradius is confluent with the anus. The hydrospires, when they
  reach this form, irresistibly recall the genital bursae of Ophiuroidea (Fig. 214, p. <a
  href="#page490">490</a>), and very possibly served the same purpose.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Reviewing the whole group of the Pelmatozoa, we see that in the Cambrian they begin
  with the extremely primitive Thecoidea and Carpoidea, together with some obscure forms which,
  combining a stem with pentamerous symmetry in the calyx, are supposed to be the forerunners of the
  Crinoidea. In the Lower Silurian or Ordovician the two groups of the Cystoidea make their
  appearance, possibly independently developed from either Carpoidea or primitive Crinoidea, which
  in this period are present in unmistakable form. In the Upper Silurian the Blastoidea appear,
  distinguishable from the most regular Cystoidea only by their hydrospires. It seems practically
  certain that they were developed from Cystoidea, and we follow Jaekel in believing that they arose
  from Dichoporita. The Carpoidea do not extend beyond the Ordovician, and by the end of the
  Carboniferous period Cystoidea and Blastoidea die out, leaving only the Crinoidea, which at that
  period were at their maximum development. From the Carboniferous to the present day the Crinoidea
  have continually decreased, leaving in recent seas, as sole representatives of the Pelmatozoa,
  only the few forms described at the beginning of this chapter.</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:3ex;"><span class="smaller">ECHINODERMATA
  (<i>CONTINUED</i>): DEVELOPMENT AND PHYLOGENY</span></p>

  <p>In Chapter XVI. it was stated that whilst a more or less perfectly developed radial symmetry
  was one of the characteristic features of the phylum Echinodermata when in the adult condition,
  yet in the immature or larval condition the members of the group have a strongly marked bilateral
  symmetry. In this feature larval Echinodermata resemble the other Phyla of the animal kingdom
  which have a well-developed coelom, such as Annelida, Mollusca, Vertebrata, etc. Since, then, the
  peculiar radial symmetry is gradually acquired during the growth of the Echinoderm, we may
  possibly discover by a close scrutiny of the life-history what is the nature and meaning of this
  departure from the ordinary type of structure among coelomate animals.</p>

  <p>There are two kinds of development met with amongst Echinodermata, which may be roughly
  characterised as the "embryonic" and the "larval" type respectively, although neither description
  is exact. In developmental histories of the first type so much reserve material is laid up in the
  egg in the form of food-yolk that the young animal whilst in the bilateral stage requires little
  or no food. In some cases, however, as in <i>Amphiura squamata</i>, the mother pours out a
  nourishing exudation; but whether this is so or not, the parent in nearly every case carries the
  young about with her until they have reached the adult condition. In some Asteroidea, as for
  instance in the Antarctic species <i>Asterias spirabilis</i> (Fig. 280), the young become fixed to
  the everted lips of the mother; in <i>Amphiura squamata</i>, and some other Ophiuroidea the eggs
  remain in the genital bursae, which serve as nurseries; in some Spatangoidea, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page602"><span class="smaller">{602}</span></span>as for instance in
  <i>Hemiaster philippi</i> (Figs. 250, 281), the eggs are carried in some of the deeply grooved
  petaloid ambulacra; whilst in Holothuroidea they may develop in the body-cavity (<i>Phyllophorus
  urna</i>), or they may adhere to the back of the mother (<i>Cucumaria crocea</i>, Fig. 259, p. <a
  href="#page573">573</a>), or they may be protected in special brood-pouches either on the ventral
  side of the parent (<i>Cucumaria laevigata</i>) or on the dorsal surface (<i>Psolus
  ephippifer</i>, Fig. 261).</p>

  <p>The majority of these cases of embryonic development have been recorded from Arctic or
  Antarctic waters; it appears as if conditions there were not favourable to the larval type of
  development. In Pelmatozoa the development of <i>Antedon rosacea</i> alone is known, and that is
  of the embryonic type.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So far, however, as their mode of propagation is known, it may confidently be affirmed that the
  development of the majority of the species of Eleutherozoa is of the second or larval type. In
  this type there is little food-yolk in the egg, and the young animal or larva is forced from a
  very early period of development to seek its own living, and hence it is usually a considerable
  time (from a fortnight to two months) before the adult form is attained. When the <i>embryos</i>
  of different groups of Eleutherozoa are compared, there is no obvious agreement in structure
  between them; but the <i>larvae</i> of the four classes of Eleutherozoa exhibit with differences
  in detail a most remarkable fundamental similarity in type, and we are accordingly justified in
  regarding the larval development as primitive, and the embryonic type as derived from it and
  differently modified in each case.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In the typical larval development the eggs are fertilised after being laid, and they then
  undergo segmentation into a number of equal, or nearly equal, segments or "blastomeres." These
  arrange themselves in the form of a hollow sphere or "blastula," the cavity of which is called the
  "blastocoel" and afterwards becomes the primary body-cavity of the larva. This cavity contains an
  albuminous fluid, at the expense of which development appears to be carried on (Fig. 282, B). The
  cells forming the blastula acquire cilia, and the embryo begins to rotate within the egg-membrane,
  which it soon bursts, and, rising to the surface of the sea, begins its larval life. The blastula
  is therefore the first well-marked larval stage, and it is found in a more or less recognisable
  form in life-histories of members of every large group in the animal kingdom. Only in the case of
  Echinodermata and of forms still lower in the scale, however, does it appear as a larval stage.
  The free-swimming blastula stage is reached in from twelve to twenty-four hours. Soon the
  spherical form of the blastula is lost; one side becomes flattened and thickened, owing to a
  multiplication of cells, so that they become taller and narrower in shape. Shortly afterwards this
  thickened plate becomes buckled inwards, encroaching on the cavity of the blastocoel. The larva
  has now reached the second stage of its development; it has become a "gastrula" (Fig. 282, C). The
  plate of thickened cells has become <span class="pagenum" id="page604"><span
  class="smaller">{604}</span></span>converted into a tube called the "archenteron" (Fig. 282, C,
  <i>arch</i>), which is the rudiment of both the alimentary canal and the coelom of the adult. This
  tube communicates with the exterior, in virtue of its mode of formation, by a single opening which
  is called the "blastopore," which becomes the anus of the later larva and adult. Whilst the
  gastrula stage is being acquired, the blastocoel or primary body-cavity is invaded by wandering
  cells budded from the wall of the archenteron (Fig. 282, A, B, C, <i>mes</i>). These cells, which
  are called "mesenchyme," are the formative cells of the skeleton, connective tissue, and wandering
  cells of the adult. When the larva has a skeleton they are formed very early, arising in the young
  blastula stage (Ophiuroidea) or in the stage immediately before the formation of the archenteron
  (Echinoidea, Fig. 282, A, B) and secreting the skeleton. When the larva is devoid of a skeleton
  (Asteroidea and Holothuroidea), the mesenchyme usually does not appear till the gastrula is fully
  formed.</p>

  <p>The gastrula stage is reached in twenty to thirty-six hours. Then one side of the larva becomes
  concave, and the cilia become restricted to a thick band surrounding this area. In this way is
  formed the rudiment of the <i>longitudinal band of cilia</i>, which is the organ of locomotion
  throughout the larval life. At the apex of the archenteron a thin-walled vesicle is formed, which
  soon becomes divided off from the rest. This vesicle, which almost immediately divides into two
  sacs, right and left, is the <span class="pagenum" id="page605"><span
  class="smaller">{605}</span></span>rudiment of the "coelom" or secondary body-cavity of the larva;
  the remainder of the archenteron forms the definitive gut, and becomes divided by constriction
  into an oesophagus, a stomach, and an intestine, and at the same time bent into a shallower or
  deeper V-shape, the concavity of which is towards the concave side of the body. Within this area
  of the surface a new funnel-shaped depression makes its appearance. This is the "stomodaeum," the
  rudiment of the mouth of the larva, and it soon joins the apex of the larval oesophagus; the
  conjoined tubes henceforth bearing the name oesophagus since the ectodermal and endodermal parts
  become indistinguishably fused. Along the sides and floor of the oesophagus is formed a V-shaped
  ridge bearing strong cilia; this is the "adoral band of cilia" which sweeps the food (consisting
  of Diatoms, Infusoria, etc.) into the mouth. The larva is now known as a Dipleurula and appears in
  four modifications, each characteristic of a Class of Eleutherozoa. These differ from one another
  principally in the following points:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) The folding of the ciliated band; (<i>b</i>)
  the divisions of the coelomic sacs; (<i>c</i>) the development and fate of the praeoral lobe
  (<i>i.e.</i> the part of the body in front of the mouth); (<i>d</i>) the fate of the larval mouth.

  posterior lateral (<i>p.l.a</i>), and post-oral (<i>p.v.a</i>) processes. At the apex of the

  prae-oral, postero-dorsal, postero-lateral, and post-oral. The postero-lateral are always much
  longer than the rest, so that the larva when swimming appears to the naked eye as a tiny V. In the
  case of <i>Ophiothrix fragilis</i> (Fig. 284, A) the postero-lateral processes are many times
  longer than the rest of the body. The Ophiopluteus was the first Echinoderm larva to be
  recognised. It was discovered by Johannes M&uuml;ller,<a id="NtA_518"
  href="#Nt_518"><sup>[518]</sup></a> who also discovered the other three types of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page607"><span class="smaller">{607}</span></span>Dipleurula. He named this
  one <i>Pluteus</i> (easel), from a fancied resemblance, when turned upside down, to a painter's
  easel. The same name was bestowed on the next type, to which it presents a superficial
  resemblance, and hence the distinguishing prefix "Ophio-" was added to the original name by
  Mortensen.</p>

  <p>(3) The <i>Echinopluteus</i>, the larva of the Echinoidea. This type is strikingly like the
  preceding one in possessing a very small prae-oral lobe and in having the processes of the
  ciliated ring supported by calcareous rods, but a close inspection of these shows that they do not
  exactly correspond to those of the Ophiopluteus. Thus we have prae-oral, postero-dorsal, and
  post-oral processes (Fig. 285), but usually no postero-lateral process, and when it does occur it
  remains short. On the other hand, an antero-lateral process unrepresented in the Ophiopluteus is
  constantly present, and in its later stage the Echinopluteus develops, out of parts of the
  ciliated ring, horizontally-placed crescentic ridges of cilia, which are termed ciliated
  epaulettes (Fig. 285, <i>a.cil.ep</i>). There may even be, as in the larva of <i>Echinus
  esculentus</i>, a second posterior set of these (Fig. 285, <i>p.cil.ep</i>). In the older larva at
  the apex of the prae-oral lobe there is an ectodermic thickening, at the base of which are
  developed nerve-cells and nerve fibres constituting a larval brain (Fig. 285, <i>ap</i>).</p>

  <p>(4) The <i>Auricularia</i>, the larva of the Holothuroidea. This type strikingly resembles the
  Bipinnaria in its external features. The prae-oral lobe is well developed, and has on its under
  surface a backwardly projecting loop of the ciliated band, which is not, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page608"><span class="smaller">{608}</span></span>however, as in the Bipinnaria, separated
  from the rest of the band. The processes of the band are much more faintly marked than in the
  Bipinnaria, the anterior median, prae-oral, and median dorsal processes being absent; but a pair
  of intermediate dorsal processes are developed in the interspace between anterior and posterior
  dorsal.</p>

  <p>In the Bipinnaria, Ophiopluteus, and Echinopluteus the coelomic vesicle, after separation from
  the archenteron, divides into right and left halves. The left then sends out a short dorsal
  process, which, fusing with the ectoderm, acquires an opening to the exterior. This opening is the
  primary madreporic pore, and the process of the left coelomic sac, which is ciliated, is the
  pore-canal. In the Auricularia the pore and pore-canal are formed <i>before</i> the division of
  the coelom. In the Bipinnaria the right and left sacs subsequently fuse in the front part of the
  prae-oral lobe. In the first three types of larva the coelomic sac on each side then undergoes a
  segmentation into anterior and posterior portions. At the hinder end of the anterior sac on each
  side a swelling occurs. That on the left side is the "hydrocoel," or rudiment of the
  water-vascular system (Fig. 287, A<sup>3</sup>, <i>l.hy</i>); it <span class="pagenum"
  id="page609"><span class="smaller">{609}</span></span>quickly assumes a crescentic form, and gives
  off five blunt outgrowths, which are the rudiments of the radial canals, and the terminal
  tentacles. It remains in connexion with the anterior coelom by a narrow neck, which later becomes
  the stone-canal. That on the right side separates completely from the right anterior coelom; it
  remains small, and forms the madreporic vesicle (Fig. 287, A<sup>3</sup>, <i>r.hy</i>) of the
  adult. In the Ophiopluteus and in the larva of <i>Asterina gibbosa</i> (<i>v. infra</i>) it
  occasionally takes on a form similar to that of the hydrocoel; from which circumstance, as well as
  from the similarity in its mode of origin, it is here regarded as a right hydrocoel, <i>i.e.</i> a
  rudimentary fellow of the organ which develops into the water-vascular system.</p>

  <p>In Auricularia (Fig. 287, D) the coelomic vesicle, after the pore-canal is formed, divides into
  an anterior and a posterior half. The posterior part then divides into right and left halves,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page610"><span class="smaller">{610}</span></span>whilst the anterior
  sac divides into dorsal and ventral halves, connected by a narrow neck. The ventral half soon
  assumes the familiar feature of the hydrocoel (Fig. 287, D<sup>3</sup>, <i>l.hy</i>), whilst the
  dorsal half forms an insignificant swelling on the course of the conjoined stone- and pore-canals,
  which represents the left anterior coelom of the other types; neither right anterior coelom nor
  right hydrocoel being developed. The neck of communication between dorsal and ventral halves is,
  of course, the stone-canal.</p>

  <p>The Dipleurula larva leads a free-swimming life for a period varying from two weeks to two
  months, and then undergoes <b>metamorphosis</b> into the adult form. The details of this process
  have been worked out in comparatively few cases; and the species in which they are most thoroughly
  known is the Asteroid <i>Asterina gibbosa</i>. The development of this species is intermediate in
  character between the embryonic and larval types. The eggs are larger than is usual among
  Asteroidea, and are filled with a bright orange yolk. The larva differs from the Bipinnaria in the
  absence of the characteristic ciliated bands and in the very early occlusion of the anus. There
  is, however, a band of cilia round the edge of the prae-oral lobe, which corresponds to portions
  of the prae-oral and post-oral bands combined of the Bipinnaria.<a id="NtA_519"
  href="#Nt_519"><sup>[519]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The larva has a form which may be described as boot-shaped (Figs. 288, 289). The sole of the
  boot is the great prae-oral lobe, behind which is the mouth. The larva takes little or no food,
  and completes its metamorphosis in ten to twelve days. It does not swim at the surface, but creeps
  slowly over the bottom by the aid of the ciliated band mentioned above, while it can also attach
  itself, using the edges of the prae-oral lobe as a sucker.</p>

  <p>After leading an existence of this kind for seven or eight days it fixes itself permanently by
  a disc-like prominence, which appears on the anterior surface of the prae-oral lobe within the
  area surrounded by the thickened rim which, as explained above, forms a margin to the prae-oral
  lobe. The larva then becomes divided by a constriction into a disc and a stalk, and the former is
  gradually converted into the body of the young Starfish, whilst <span class="pagenum"
  id="page611"><span class="smaller">{611}</span></span>the latter continually diminishes in size,
  and eventually entirely disappears, when the young Starfish commences to walk about on its podia.
  The disc becomes bent downwards and to the left, so as to make nearly a right angle with the
  stalk, and the last vestige of the latter springs from the peristome of the Starfish inside the
  water-vascular ring (Figs. 289, B, C).</p>

  <p>The form of the Starfish is attained principally by the preponderant growth of the left
  hydrocoel and of the left posterior coelom. Both these sacs take on the form of hoops, which, by
  the meeting of their ends, are converted into rings. The hydrocoel has already grown out into five
  lobes, which are the rudiments of the radial water-vascular canals, and the tips of which become
  the terminal sensory tentacles (Figs. 288, 289, 1-5); but now the left posterior coelom grows out
  into five lobes also, forming a parallel but outer ring. These lobes (Figs. 288, 289, I.-V.) are
  the rudiments of the arms, which are at first quite independent of those of the radial canals, but
  gradually, when the larva has attained the age of nine days (Fig. 289, B, C), they become applied
  to the outgrowths of the hydrocoel. These by this time have developed each two pairs of branches,
  the rudiments of the first two pairs of tube-feet in each radius. The larval mouth vanishes, and a
  new mouth is formed on the left side in the centre of the hydrocoel ring, when the metamorphosis
  is complete. The adult anus is <span class="pagenum" id="page612"><span
  class="smaller">{612}</span></span>formed about the same time. The primary pore-canal in
  <i>Asterina</i> as in all Dipleurulae opens into the anterior coelom; the stone-canal is formed
  from a ciliated groove running along the neck of communication between this and the hydrocoel. The
  constriction dividing the body into disc and stalk divides the anterior coelom (single in
  <i>Asterina</i> as in the older Bipinnaria) into two parts; the portion included in the disc forms
  the axial sinus of the adult. The lower end of the axial sinus expands and surrounds the adult
  mouth, forming the inner perihaemal ring; the outer perihaemal ring is formed by the juxtaposition
  of four wedge-shaped outgrowths from the left posterior coelom and one from the anterior coelom.
  From these the radial perihaemal canals subsequently grow out into the arms. The metamorphosis of
  Bipinnaria has been well worked out by Goto,<a id="NtA_520" href="#Nt_520"><sup>[520]</sup></a>
  and it agrees in essential features with that of <i>Asterina gibbosa</i>; in fact, the differences
  which Goto maintains between the two types may be reasonably explained on the supposition of some
  stages having escaped the notice of this observer. The larva develops on the apex of the prae-oral
  lobe three papillae for occasional attachment,<a id="NtA_521" href="#Nt_521"><sup>[521]</sup></a>
  and in the centre of these a cup-shaped disc for permanent fixation when the prae-oral lobe is
  converted into a stalk. When these papillae (Fig. 290, <i>fix</i>) have been developed the larva
  is known as a Brachiolaria.</p>

  <p>The metamorphoses of the other types of Dipleurula contain no fixed stage. They are what might
  be called "cataclysmal metamorphoses." That is to say, the outer form and habits of the larva are
  preserved till the last moment, whilst the organs of the adult are being gradually perfected; then
  in an hour or two all trace of larval structures disappears. The Ophiopluteus preserves the larval
  mouth, round which the hydrocoel grows; the long lateral ciliated processes are preserved till the
  animal has attained all the adult characters. Before this, however, it passes through what may be
  called an "Asteroid" stage in development, in which the ambulacral grooves are open. The
  Echinopluteus loses both larval mouth and anus. It develops the adult organs on the floor of a
  sac-like invagination of the ectoderm, situated on the left side within a loop of the ciliated
  band (Fig. 291, B, C). This invagination becomes completely closed. It is termed the "amniotic
  cavity," and its roof is termed the "amnion." On its floor are developed the primary tentacles,
  terminating the radial canals, as well as a number of spines. After taking on a creeping life and
  losing its larval appendages, the young Sea-urchin passes through an "Asteroid" condition, in
  which the arched dorsal surface, the future periproct, is greater in extent than the ventral, and
  the radial canals run horizontally out from the water-vascular ring and terminate in free movable
  podia (Fig. 291, C and D, <i>pod</i>), ending in suckers, in the centre of which are pointed
  sense-organs. These <span class="pagenum" id="page614"><span
  class="smaller">{614}</span></span>podia become later enclosed in grooves in the corona, and are
  reduced to vestiges in the adult.</p>

  <p>The Auricularia is the only type of Dipleurula in which larval mouth and anus are retained. For
  this reason it has been supposed that its median plane of symmetry remains the median plane of the
  adult. The researches of Bury<a id="NtA_522" href="#Nt_522"><sup>[522]</sup></a> have shown that
  this is not so. As in other types of Dipleurula (with the possible exception of the Ophiopluteus)
  the adult position of the <span class="pagenum" id="page615"><span
  class="smaller">{615}</span></span>mouth is on the left side of the larva, and in the commencement
  of the metamorphosis the mouth migrates into this position (Fig. 286, C). Then the rudimentary
  prae-oral lobe is rapidly absorbed, so that the mouth again acquires a terminal position. The
  hydrocoel (Fig. 286, A, <i>hy</i>) has by this time completely encircled the oesophagus, and from
  it grow out the radial canals which bud off the feelers<a id="NtA_523"
  href="#Nt_523"><sup>[523]</sup></a> (buccal tentacles) into the larval stomodaeum. This, although
  it later flattens out to form the adult peristome, forms in these stages an almost closed sac,
  reminding us of the amniotic cavity in the Echinopluteus. The ciliated band breaks up into a
  number of pieces, which rearrange themselves so as to form a series of transverse rings of cilia;
  so that the free-swimming life can be carried on somewhat longer. The animal in this stage is
  called a "pupa" (Fig. 292); it eventually loses the rings, drops to the bottom, and develops
  tube-feet. From specimens which the author has seen, he has little doubt that in some cases the
  young animal passes through an "Echinoid" stage, for it possesses, besides the feelers, only
  median tube-feet, terminating the radial canals, and it is covered by a cuirass of plates, which
  recalls the Echinoid corona.<a id="NtA_524" href="#Nt_524"><sup>[524]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Reviewing the development of the Eleutherozoa in the light of the facts so far presented, and
  using the same method of reasoning which is employed in the case of other groups of animals, we
  seem to be justified in concluding that the Echinodermata are descended from a simple
  free-swimming ancestor possessing the fundamental characters of the Dipleurula. These would
  include a longitudinal folded band of cilia as the principal organ of locomotion; a thickened
  plate of nervous epithelium at <span class="pagenum" id="page616"><span
  class="smaller">{616}</span></span>the anterior end serving as combined sense-organ and brain; a
  V-shaped band of cilia projecting into the oesophagus as the organ of nutrition; a wide, shallow
  stomodaeum and an alimentary canal consisting of three well-marked divisions, viz. oesophagus,
  stomach, and intestine; and finally a secondary body-cavity or coelom, consisting of three
  divisions on each side, though possibly the most anterior pair were confluent in the prae-oral
  lobe. On the left side the anterior coelom opened to the exterior by a short ciliated canal. To
  the hypothetical group so defined which were certainly not Echinodermata the name <span

  <p>Now amongst the lowest types of animal in which traces of Vertebrate structure can be detected,
  there is one group, the <span class="sc">Hemichordata</span> (Vol. VII. p. 3), in which there is a
  larva which strikingly recalls the Dipleurula. This larval form belongs to Balanoglossus and is
  called the Tornaria. It possesses a well-marked prae-oral lobe and a folded longitudinal ciliated
  band, which resembles that of Auricularia. Its peculiarity is that in addition there is a
  posterior ring of cilia (Fig. 293, <i>p</i>). The coelom is in five divisions:&mdash;a median
  anterior sac (<i>a.c</i>) opening to the exterior by a short ciliated canal on the left side; and
  paired middle divisions (<i>m.c</i>) and posterior divisions (<i>p.c</i>). At the apex of the
  prae-oral lobe there is a plate consisting of sensory epithelium, with nerve-fibres at its base,
  which acts as a brain. Tornaria undergoes metamorphosis, assumes a worm-like form, and takes on a
  burrowing life. The five divisions of <span class="pagenum" id="page617"><span
  class="smaller">{617}</span></span>the coelom are retained, and it can be proved that the
  pore-canal, like the madreporite of Echinodermata, is used for taking in water. Further, there are
  two aberrant sessile members of the group (<i>Cephalodiscus</i> and <i>Rhabdopleura</i>), in which
  the middle divisions of the coelom which would correspond to the hydrocoels are produced into long
  arms, each with a double row of ciliated tentacles, which strikingly recall the radial canals and
  podia of the Pelmatozoa. Taking all these facts into consideration, it seems probable that
  Vertebrata and Echinodermata both arose from <span class="sc">Protocoelomata</span>.</p>

  <p>When we turn to the developmental history of Echinodermata for light on the question as to how
  the bilaterally symmetrical ancestor became converted into the radially symmetrical Echinoderm, it
  seems probable that only in the development of the Asteroidea can we hope to find the solution of
  the problem. The abrupt changes of habits shown in the metamorphoses of the other types are
  clearly secondary phenomena. No species of animal could suddenly change its habits from swimming
  by means of cilia to walking with tube-feet. In the development, however, of <i>Asterina
  gibbosa</i> we get a hint of the way in which a free-swimming life could alternate with periods of
  temporary fixation, gradually passing into a condition in which the fixation was permanent. This
  period in the history of the race when ancestral Echinodermata were sessile would mark the point
  at which Eleutherozoa diverged from Pelmatozoa, and the former existence of a fixed ancestor
  explains the tendency first to asymmetry and later to radial symmetry. Bilateral symmetry is
  characteristic of most free-swimming animals which have to pursue a straight course through the
  water, but in fixed forms no disadvantage arises from want of symmetry. A radial disposition of
  organs is, however, valuable to them, since food must be sought and danger avoided from all points
  of the compass; and hence we can understand, when fixation became permanent, how one hydrocoel
  could grow larger than the other, and finally assume the form of a ring.</p>

  <p>The last question which arises is the vexed one of the mutual relationships of the various
  Classes constituting the Phylum. Before attempting to seek for light on this problem from

  <p>The eggs are comparatively large and full of food-yolk, and they adhere for a considerable
  period to the pinnules. They pass through a large portion of the development within the
  egg-membrane. The blastula and gastrula are formed in the usual way, but the formation of the
  coelom is most remarkable (Fig. 287, E<sup>1</sup>, E<sup>2</sup>). The archenteron divides into
  anterior and posterior divisions. The posterior divides into right and left, posterior coelomic
  sacs, but before the division is complete a dorsal and a ventral tongue grow out from the anterior
  division and unite posteriorly, encircling the band of connexion between right and left posterior
  coelomic sacs like a ring. This band of connexion becomes solid and is absorbed, and <i>pari
  passu</i> the ring becomes converted, by the disappearance of its central opening, into a sac,
  which is the definitive gut (Fig. 287, E). The rest of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page619"><span class="smaller">{619}</span></span>anterior division divides into a
  thick-walled sac, the hydrocoel, on the left, and a median thin-walled anterior coelom, which
  sends a long extension into the anterior portion of the larva, which we may compare to the
  prae-oral lobe of the Bipinnaria. The anterior coelom communicates with the exterior by a short
  pore-canal, and later forms a connexion, the stone-canal, with the hydrocoel. At the apex of the
  prae-oral lobe there is formed a thickened patch of ectoderm, bearing stiff sensory hairs, and
  having at their bases nerve-fibres and ganglion cells. This larval brain corresponds to that of
  the Tornaria and Echinopluteus. Behind the brain there is a glandular pit, which is used for
  fixation, and recalls the similar organ in the Bipinnaria. A series of ciliated rings is then
  formed, and between the second and third of them an oval depression appears. This is the
  stomodaeum; but as the larva takes no food it does not communicate with the gut (Fig. 295, A,
  <i>stom</i>).</p>

  <p>The larva next escapes from the egg-membrane and swims freely for a day or two, and then, like
  the Bipinnaria, fixes itself by the apex of the prae-oral lobe, which is converted into a stalk.
  The larval stomodaeum closes, and the oesophagus of the adult appears as a solid peg of cells
  abutting against it; round this peg the hydrocoel grows like a ring.</p>

  <p>The closed stomodaeum and the underlying hydrocoel are now rotated backwards until they come to
  be at the end of the animal opposite the stalk (Fig. 295, C). The left posterior coelom, which has
  also, as in the Asteroid larva, assumed a hoop-like form, is carried along with them; but the
  right posterior coelom becomes shifted forwards and sends out five outgrowths into the stalk,
  which form the rudiments of the chambered organ, and a central one as a continuation of the
  genital stolon (Fig. 295, D, <i>gen.st</i>), the extension of the anterior coelom (Fig. 294, B)
  having disappeared.</p>

  <p>Then the outer wall of the stomodaeum splits into five valves&mdash;the future oral valves. The
  radial canals appear as freely projecting tentacles, which issue in the intervals of these valves
  and soon acquire two pairs of lateral branches. The skeleton consists of five oral plates in the
  oral valves, of a ring of five basals, of three small under-basals, and of a series of
  "columnals," <i>i.e.</i> stem-ossicles, as rings embracing the stalk. The area of attachment is
  supported by a "foot-plate." The radial <span class="pagenum" id="page620"><span
  class="smaller">{620}</span></span>plates next appear as a ring of small ossicles between the
  orals and basals, and simultaneously the arms make their appearance as five outgrowths supported
  by the first radials, and by the other radials when these appear. The free radial canals now
  become adherent to the arms, but these canals soon give off paired branches of unlimited growth,
  which are supported by bifurcations of the primitive arms, and in this way the ten arms of the
  adult are established. So far, then, as the water-vascular system is concerned, the apparent
  forking is not a true dichotomy, but results from the production of two opposite branches, whilst
  the main axis ceases to grow. The appearance of cirri marks the fusion of the uppermost
  stem-ossicles to form a centro-dorsal, and shortly afterwards the young <i>Antedon</i> snaps off
  its stem and swims away.</p>

  <p>Now in reviewing this life-history we cannot fail to be struck with resemblances to the
  development of Asteroidea, and especially to that of <i>Asterina gibbosa</i>. The absence of a
  connexion between stomodaeum and gut is due to the embryonic mode of life. On the other hand, the
  presence of a long prae-oral lobe, containing an extension of the anterior coelom and having a
  fixing organ at its apex, can only be paralleled among Asteroidea. In broad outlines, then, up to
  the period of fixation the two developments are parallel, but after this point a <span
  class="pagenum" id="page621"><span class="smaller">{621}</span></span>divergence takes place,
  which points clearly to the splitting of the Echinoderm stem into two main branches, corresponding
  with two different sets of habits. In the Eleutherozoan stock, represented by the development of
  the Asteroidea, the disc became flexed ventrally on the stalk, so that the mouth and podia were
  brought within reach of material drifting along the bottom, which the podia were employed to
  seize. As a consequence the base of the stalk was brought near the mouth, and so it came about
  that the hydrocoel, when it became a ring, encircled both. In the Pelmatozoan stock, on the other
  hand, the podia and mouth are rotated upwards and backwards from the stalk, which thus came to
  have an aboral position (Fig. 296, B). The podia are thus placed in a favourable position for
  capturing free-swimming organisms, which their cilia sweep toward them. It is worthy of note that
  a similar change of position of the mouth occurs in other groups of animals which have similar
  habits (Polyzoa Entoprocta, Tunicata).</p>

  <p>The division therefore of the phylum must have occurred at an extremely remote epoch, before
  the hydrocoel was a closed ring, and before, therefore, radial symmetry was completely
  attained.</p>

  <p>Turning now to the question of the origin of the classes of Eleutherozoa, we find that the
  study of development strongly reinforces the views gained from the study of adult anatomy. The
  Asteroidea are the most primitive group; only in their case <span class="pagenum"
  id="page622"><span class="smaller">{622}</span></span>is the fixed stage retained, and both
  Ophiuroidea and Echinoidea pass through an Asteroid stage in development. The only serious
  competitors for the position are the Holothuroidea, which many have imagined to have been directly
  derived from Cystoidea (in the old sense; better Thecoidea). This view, though adopted by Semon,<a
  id="NtA_525" href="#Nt_525"><sup>[525]</sup></a> Haeckel,<a id="NtA_526"
  href="#Nt_526"><sup>[526]</sup></a> and Bather,<a id="NtA_527" href="#Nt_527"><sup>[527]</sup></a>
  is open to many objections. The type of Holothuroid development referred to in these discussions
  is that of the extremely aberrant <i>Synapta digitata</i>, in which the radial canals are
  vestigial structures which disappear in the adult. In this species, where the feelers are
  multiplied, some originate in the larva directly from the water-vascular ring, and thus alternate
  with the canals. From this circumstance Semon drew the conclusion that the radial canals of
  Holothuroidea are not homologous with those of other Echinoderms, but this conclusion is
  contradicted by the development of more normal species, in which all the feelers spring from the
  radial canals. The meridional course of these canals, the closure of the ambulacral grooves,
  coupled with the retention of a nervous ectoderm, are all features found in Echinoidea. So is also
  a reduction in the number of the genital organs, on which Bell<a id="NtA_528"
  href="#Nt_528"><sup>[528]</sup></a> laid such stress that he separated Holothuroidea from all
  other Echinoderms. But if in Spatangoidea a reduction to four and even three can take place (Fig.
  246, p. <a href="#page552">552</a>), why should a reduction to two or one excite surprise? The
  primitive outer appearance of the Auricularia is counterbalanced by the development of the coelom,
  which is much modified, so that the primitive bilateral arrangement is obscured. If, then,
  Asteroidea are the most primitive Eleutherozoa, we may imagine that primitive Echinoidea were
  derived from Asteroidea through adaptation to life in crevices, where an upward bending of the
  radii was of advantage, in order to enable the animal to attach its podia above as well as below
  itself; and that Holothuroidea arose from primitive Echinoidea in which the plates of the corona
  were still movable, through a further adaptation to narrow crevices, where worm-like wriggling
  would be the most successful method of adapting themselves to their environment.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page623"><span class="smaller">{623}</span></span></div>

  <p>The final result, then, of all our inquiries leads us to a view of the mutual affinities of the
  classes of Echinoderms, which may be indicated in the following table<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="ac w40 fcenter sp2">

    ></a>
  </div>

  <p>We shall hazard the prophecy that if ever pre-Cambrian Echinoderms are found, there will be
  amongst them small stalked forms which may be superficially classed with "Cystids," but which are
  in reality the fixed ancestors of Asteroidea. They should have an irregular skeleton, and be
  devoid of arms, which are secondary formations; but they should indicate, by the proximity of the
  mouth to the stalk and by the relation to the stalk of the grooves for the podia, that they have
  diverged from the Pelmatozoan stock, and are the ancestors of Eleutherozoa.</p>

    useful term "Protista," introduced by Haeckel to designate such beings at large, without

    <p>A solid substratum is required, to which the lower surface adheres slightly: that movement is
    complicated by a sort of rolling over of the upper surface, constantly prolonging the front of
    the pseudopodium, while the material of the lower surface is brought up behind. H. S. Jennings,

    <p>If the protoplasm contains visible granules, as it usually does, within a clear external
    layer, we see that these stream constantly forwards along the central axis of each process as it
    forms, and backwards just within the clear layer all round, like a fountain playing in a
    bell-jar. This motion is most marked when a new pseudopodium is put forth, and ceases when it

    <p>For the study of the structure of protoplasm under the microscope it is necessary to examine
    it in very thin layers, such as can for the most part be obtained only by mechanical methods
    (section-cutting, etc.). These methods, again, can only be applied to fixed specimens, for
    natural death is followed by rapid changes, and notably by softening, which makes the tissue
    less suitable for our methods. We further bring out and make obvious pre-existing
    differentiations of our specimens by various methods of staining with such dyes as logwood and
    cochineal and their derivatives, and coal-tar pigments (see also p. <a href="#page11">11</a>

    <p>A. Bolles Lee, in his <i>Microtomist's Vade Mecum</i>, 1st ed. (1885), pointed out that
    "Clearing reagents are liquids whose primary function is to make microscopic preparations
    transparent by penetrating amongst the highly refractive elements of which the tissues are
    composed, having an index of refraction not greatly inferior to that of the tissues to be
    cleared" (p. <a href="#page213">213</a>). We showed later ("The State in which Water exists in
    Live Protoplasm," in <i>Rep. Brit. Ass.</i> 1889, p. 645, and <i>Journ. Roy. Micr. Soc.</i>
    1890, p. 441) that since the refractivity of living protoplasm is only 1.363-1.368, it follows
    that the water in the living protoplasm is in a state of perfect physical combination, like the
    water of a solution of gum [read a "mucilage"] or of a jelly. Now the phenomena of protoplasmic
    motions as studied in the Rhizopoda and in the vegetable cell, seem absolutely to preclude the
    jelly supposition, and for these cases we must admit that living protoplasm is a viscid liquid
    whose refractivity is probably the mean of the two constituents separated by death, the one
    solid, the other a watery solution: and death is for us essentially a process of precipitation
    (or better, "desolution"). For further work on these lines see Hardy in <i>Journ. Physiol.</i>
    vol. xxiv. 1899, p. 158, and Fischer, <i>Fixirung u. F&auml;rbung</i>, 1900.</p>

    <p>In its original use "automatism" designates the continuous sequence and combination of
    actions, without external interference, performed by complex machines designed and made for
    specific ends by intelligent beings: thus we speak correctly of "automatic ball bearings" that
    tighten of themselves when they become loose; but even these cannot take up fresh steel and
    redeposit it, either to replace the worn parts or to strengthen a tube that is bending under a
    stress.</p>

    <p>Proteids are organic compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, of which

    <p>The specific gravity of living protoplasm has been estimated by determining the density of a
    solution of gum in which certain Infusoria float freely at any depth. It was found by the
    concurrent results of Julia B. Platt and Stephen R. Williams (see <i>Amer. Natural.</i> xxxiii.
    1899, p. 31, xxxiv. 1900, p. 95) to be from 1.014 to 1.019, while the Metazoon <i>Hydra</i> was
    found to give a density of only 1.0095 to 1.0115. The difference of about 0.006, it is easy to
    show, is of the correct "order of magnitude," if we admit that the actual substance of the Hydra
    has about the same specific gravity as the Infusorian, while the density of the whole is
    lightened by the watery contents of the internal cavity, etc. Jensen obtained a much higher
    result for <i>Paramecium</i>, using a solution of the crystalloid substance, potassium
    carbonate; but it is almost certain that this would be readily absorbed by the organism, and so
    raise its density in the course of the experiment.</p>

    <p>Jennings, in his studies on <i>Reactions to Stimuli in Unicellular Organisms</i> (1899-1900),
    has shown that whatever be the nature of the repellent stimulus, chemical or mechanical or
    thermal, the reaction of <i>Paramecium</i> and many other Protista is always the same. It swims
    backward a short distance, turns towards the aboral surface, and then having thus reversed swims
    on again in the new direction, front foremost as before. Apparent "positive taxies" are often
    really negative ones; for if the <i>Paramecium</i> be placed in water containing CO<sub>2</sub>
    it shows the reaction not on entering the part charged with this acid, but on passing away from
    it into purer water, so that it continually tends to turn back into the acid part, while within
    it or in the water at a distance not yet charged it swims about irregularly.  It appears due to
    this that the individuals become aggregated together, as they excrete this gas into the water.
    If a repellent substance diffuse towards the hinder end of a <i>Paramecium</i>, the response,
    instead of carrying it away, brings it into the region of greater concentration, and may thus
    kill it.</p>

    <p>Let us take the case of a 1-centimetre cube, growing to the size of a 2-centimetre cube. The
    superficial area of the 1 cm. cube measures 6 square centimetres, and its bulk is 1 cubic
    centimetre. The superficial area of the 2-centimetre cube measures 24 square centimetres, while
    its volume measures 8 cubic centimetres. Thus the larger cube has only 3 cm. sq. of surface to
    every cubic cm. of volume, instead of 6; in other words, the ratio of surface to volume has been
    halved by growth. Three successive bipartitions of the larger cube will divide it into eight
    separate 1-centimetre cubes, each now possessing the original ratio of surface to volume.</p>

    <p>The nucleus is regarded by some as equivalent to a central nervous organ for the cell; by
    others, such as G. Mann and Verworn, as the chief chemical centre of the cell, and notably the
    seat of the secretion of the zymases or ferments that play so important a part in its life-work;
    for it is found that a Protist deprived of its nucleus can execute its wonted movements, but can
    neither digest nor grow. This conclusion may appear to be rather sweeping and premature, but we
    have seen that the changes of surface tension are the direct antecedents of the motions of the
    cytoplasm, we know that such changes are induced by chemical changes; and thus the
    nucleus&mdash;if it be the central laboratory to which such changes are ultimately
    due&mdash;would really in a certain sense be a directive centre.</p>

    <p>The "centriole" is a minute granule sometimes recognisable in the centre of the centrosphere,
    and undergoing fission in advance. But centrosomes are often found without a distinction into
    centrosphere and centriole, and there is much confusion in the use of the terms.</p>

    <p>The origin of the centrosomes is a problem not yet certainly solved, if indeed it be
    susceptible of any universal solution. They are certainly absent in many plants; and, on the
    other hand, structures which correspond to them often appear in mitotic divisions of Protista.
    In some cases the centrosomes are undoubtedly of nuclear origin, and pass out through the
    nuclear wall into the cytoplasm.</p>

    forces as magnetism, static electricity, and even capillarity, and models utilising such
    physical forces have been devised to represent the strain-figures of the cell, the cell forces

    <p>Temporary plastogamy is a process found in some Foraminifera, where two organisms unite by
    their cytoplasms so that there can be complete blending of these, while the nuclei remain
    distinct: they ultimately separate again. In the conjugation of the Infusoria, the union of the

    <p>One obvious effect of brood-formation is to augment rapidly the ratio of superficial area to
    bulk: after only three divisions (p. <a href="#page23">23</a>, note) the ratio is doubled; if
    the divisions be nine in succession so as to produce a brood of 512, the ratio is increased
    eightfold, on the supposition that the figure is preserved. However, the brood-mother-cell is
    usually spherical, while zoospores are mostly elongated, thus giving an additional increase to
    the surface, which we may correlate with that increased activity; so that they disseminate the
    species, spreading far and wide, and justifying the name of "spore" in its primitive sense (from

    <p>The pigment is singularly resistant and insoluble, and shows no proteid reaction. Borgert
    states that it appears to be formed in the oral part of the endoplasm, and to pass through the
    astropyle into the ectoplasm, where it accumulates. It is probably a product of excretion, and
    may serve, by its retention, indirectly to augment the surface. See Borgert, "Ueb. die

    <p>Delage has well explained the action of the single anterior flagellum which waves in a
    continuous spiral like a loaded string whirled round one's head; it thus induces a movement of
    the water, beyond its actual range, backwards and outwards, maintained by a constant influx from
    behind, which carries the cell onward at the same time that it necessarily rotates round its
    axis. If there is a pair of symmetrically placed flagella they co-operate like the arms of a
    swimmer; when the second flagellum is unilateral the motion is most erratic, as seen in the
    Bodonidae (and the zoospores of many Chytridieae, which have most of the characters of the
    Flagellates, though habitually removed to the Fungi).</p>

    <p>In <i>Cercomonas dujardinii</i>, <i>Polytoma uvella</i>, and <i>Tetramitus rostratus</i> the
    gametes resemble the ordinary forms and are isogamous. In <i>Monas dallingeri</i> and <i>Bodo
    caudatus</i> conjugation takes place between one of the ordinary form and size and another
    similar but smaller. In <i>Dallingeria drysdali</i> the one has the ordinary size and form, the
    other is equal in size, but has only one flagellum, not three; in <i>Bodo saltans</i> they are
    unequal, the larger gamete arising in the ordinary way by longitudinal fission, the smaller by
    transverse division. Doubt has been thrown on the validity of our authors' results by subsequent
    observers abroad; but I can find no evidence that these have even attempted to repeat the
    English observations under the same severely critical conditions, and therefore consider the
    attacks so far unjustified. Schaudinn has observed conjugation between <i>Trichomonas</i>
    individuals which have lost their flagella and become amoeboid; also in <i>Lamblia
    intestinalis</i> and in <i>Trypanosoma</i> (<i>Halteridium</i>?) <i>noctuae</i> (Fig. 39)
    "Reduction-divisions" (see p. <a href="#page75">75</a>, note 1) of the nuclei take place before
    fusion, and the nuclear phenomena are described as "complicated" (<i>Arb. Kais.
    Gesundheitsamte</i>, xx. 1904, p. 387). <i>Paramoeba eilhardii</i> in its adult state is
    colourless, amoeboid, multiciliate. It forms a brood cyst, from which are liberated flagellate
    zoospores, with a chromatophore, which reproduce by longitudinal fission in this state. They may
    also conjugate.</p>

    <p>Each membranella is a transversely elongated oval in reality, and below it is a double row of
    basal granules, corresponding to the individual cilia that constitute it. Similarly, the

    <p>Tail-like appendages are found in <i>Scaphiodon</i> and in <i>Dysteria</i> and its allies
    (Gymnostomaceae), <i>Urocentrum</i> (Aspirotrichaceae), <i>Discomorpha</i> and
    <i>Caenomorpha</i> (Heterotrichaceae). In the first two and last two cases they are
    prolongations of the body; in the third an aggregate of cilia. One or more long caudal setiform
    cilia are present in the genera <i>Lembadion</i>, <i>Pleuronema</i>, <i>Cyclidium</i>,
    <i>Lembus</i>, <i>Cinetochilum</i>, <i>Ancistrum</i>, and <i>Uronema</i>; all these are addicted
    to making springing darts. Tufts of cilia of exceptional character often serve for temporary
    attachment. The stalk (or at least its external tube) of the Peritrichaceae appears to be the
    chitinous excretion of a zone of such cilia. Faur&eacute;-Fremiet terms such a zone or annular brush a
    "scopula" ("Struct. de l'app. fixateur chez les Vorticellides," <i>Arch. Protist.</i> vi. 1905,
    p. 207). For a discussion of the finer structure of the cilia in Ciliata, and the mechanism of
    their action, see Schuberg, <i>Arch. Protist.</i> vi. 1905, p. 61.</p>

    <p><i>Gruber</i> (<i>Ber. Ges. Freib.</i> 1888) has shown that in several marine Ciliata the
    meganucleus is represented by an enormous number of minute granules disseminated through the
    endosarc, which, on the approach of fission, unite into a single meganucleus. As an adjacent
    micronucleus makes its appearance at this stage, he infers that the micronucleus must be also
    resolved in the intermediate life of the cell into granules too small for recognition under the
    highest magnification attainable, and that they must then coalesce.</p>

    <p>In the peculiar Peritrichan <i>Spirochona</i> the division of the meganucleus is a much more
    complex process than usual, and recalls that of the undifferentiated nuclei of many Rhizopods
    (see Rompel in <i>Z. wiss. Zool.</i> lviii. 1894, p. 618). <i>Opalina</i> has neither mouth nor
    anus, nor contractile vacuole, but a large number of similar nuclei, that divide by a true
    mitotic process, like micronuclei.  We have referred it (pp. <a href="#page114">114</a>, <a

    <p>Calkins has recently found that the vitality within a cycle is rhythmical, with alternations
    of more and of less frequent fissions, under the same set of conditions; and that minute doses
    of beef-tea or various mineral salts will not only keep up the higher rate, but even stave off
    senescence. Minute doses of alcohol will keep up the higher rate, but not avert senescence. He
    considers that Maupas' generalisations are in most respects too sweeping (<i>Arch. Entw.</i> xv.
    1902, p. 139). But Dr. James Y. Simpson informs me that the possibility of stimulative
    regeneration has been found to be limited. See also Calkins and Lieb, <i>Arch. Prot.</i> i.

    <p>The analogy of Echinoidea (see p. <a href="#page529">529</a>) might suggest that, like the
    lacteals in man, these strands were channels along which the products of digestion diffused
    outward. No connexion, however, between the oral ring and the alimentary canal has been made
    out, nor do there appear to be such strands developed in the proximity of the wall of the
    digestive tube. A connexion between the aboral ring and the rectum through a mesenteric cord has
    been asserted, but this is doubtful.</p>

    <p>Mr. E. W. L. Holt, Scientific Adviser to the Irish Board of Fisheries, casts doubt (<i>in
    litt.</i>) on much of this supposed excavation. While disclaiming any novelty in this
    observation, he points out that in many cases one side of the cavity is formed by calcareous
    algae, and it seems as if the animal wanders into a crevice, in which it is imprisoned by the
    growth of this plant.</p>
